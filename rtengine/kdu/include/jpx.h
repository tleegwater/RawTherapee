           fragment.  These features are provided to overcome the lack
           of foresight in the design of the fragment list box.  As a

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function provides an alternative way to open the underlying
           `jp2_input_box' so as to read the byte ranges referenced by a
           fragment list, as though this information were contained in a
           single contiguous box.  The supplied `frag_list' object provides a
           list of byte ranges into one or more files (or URL's), identified
           by the `data_refs' object.  These together represent the contents
           of a virtual box, whose box type may be arbitrarily supplied
           using `box_type'.  Fragment lists may be found within fragment
           table boxes, in which case they refer to codestreams and
           `box_type' is best set to `jp2_codestream_4cc', since the
           present function allows the codestream to be read as though it
           were a contiguous codestream.  Fragment lists may also be found
           within cross reference boxes, in which case the box type should
           be set to that of the cross-referenced box.  In any case, the
           choice of box type has no impact on how the box will be read,
           provided only that it must not be 0.
         [RETURNS]
           The function currently always returns true.
         [ARG: ultimate_src]
           This argument must not be NULL.  It must point to the
           `jp2_family_src' object from which the fragment list information
           was read.  This is important, because the fragment list has
           a special way of referring back to this source.  If the ultimate
           data source for this object is a dynamic cache, rather than a
           file or `kdu_compressed_source' object, the `open_as' function
           will succeed, but all calls to `read' will fail to actually read
           any data.  This could change in the future, but for the moment
           it is a reasonable policy, since caching data sources are typically
           used by JPIP client-server applications and JPIP provides a
           more efficient and architecture neutral mechanism to completely
           bypass all fragment lists.
         [ARG: data_refs]
           This interface is allowed to be empty.  In this case, however,
           any call to `read' which requires access to a fragment with
           non-zero url index will fail to read into that fragment.

           both to identify the contents of the file and also to
           generate "fully understand" and "decode completely" expressions.
           [//]
           The "fully understand" and "decode completely" expressions are
           each evaluated by taking the logical AND of a collection of
           sub-expressions.  Each sub_expression is evaluated by taking the
           logical OR of a collection of features.  If any of the features
           identified by the sub-expression is available to the reader, that
           sub-expression evaluates to true.  If all sub-expressions
           evaluate to true, the corresponding "fully understand" or
           "decode completely" expression evaluates to true.  If there are
           no sub-expressions at all, the "fully understand" and
           "decode completely" expressions also evaluate to true.
           [//]
           For an explanation of the difference between the "fully understand"
           and "decode completely" expressions, see the comments appearing
           with the `test_fully_understand' and `test_decode_completely'
           functions.
           [//]
           In addition to the sub-expressions generated here, the `jpx_target'
           object builds its own sub-expressions to represent the features
           it knows about.  The features which it knows about are those
           marked with an asterisk in the list of standard features appearing
           with the `check_feature' function.  If any of those features
           are not explicitly used to form sub-expressions by means of the
           present function, they will be formed into sub-expressions which
           identify them as required both to completely decode and to fully
           understand the file's contents, wherever this makes sense.
         [ARG: feature_id]
           See the `check_standard_feature' function for a list of standard
           feature identifiers.
         [ARG: fully_understand_sub_expression]
           Indicates which sub-expression of the "fully understand" expression
           this feature is being added to.  The index has no particular
           meaning except to associate multiple features in the same
           sub-expression with one another.  However, valid
           sub-expression indices must lie in the range 0 to 254.  The
           special value of 255 means that the feature is not being added to
           any "fully understand" sub-expression.  This is useful if the
           feature is only to be added to "decode completely" sub-expressions.
           It also provides a useful mechanism for preventing the internal
           object from automatically asserting that the feature is required
           to fully understand the file, if that feature is believed to have
           been used.

                interface.
           [>>] The `must_exists' argument may be disregarded if the
                current interface was obtained without the `must_exists'
                condition being asserted -- in other words, if the current
                interface describes a frame whose existence was not
                certain at the point when it was obtained, the interface
                returned by this function might also describe a frame whose
                existence is not certain, even if `must_exist' is set to
                true here.

           seconds, where TS is the value reported by
           `jpx_composition::get_timescale' -- in practice, TS is currently

           [//]
           Unless this interface was created with the `include_persistents'
           flag disabled (see `jpx_composition::access_frame'), the number
           of instructions returned by this function includes the accumulated
           instructions associated with all relevant earlier frames that
           are marked as "persistent".  This relieves the application of the
           need to explicitly follow links to earlier persistent frames.
         [RETURNS]
           Total number of compositing instructions required to render
           the frame, or 0 if the object is empty.
         [ARG: start_time]
           Used to return the frame's absolute starting time, measured
           in multiples of 1/TS seconds (TS is the value returned by
           `jpx_composition::get_timescale'), relative to the start of the
           first frame defined by the file's top-level Composition box.
         [ARG: duration]
           Used to return the frame's duration, measured in multiples of 1/TS
           seconds (TS is the value returned by
           `jpx_compostion::get_timescale').
           [//]
           Note that a `duration' of 0 corresponds to a `LIFE' value of
           0x7FFFFFFF within the relevant compositing instruction.  The
           standard (IS15444-2) states that in this case, the frame should
           be treated as a "Pause" instruction during animation playback.
           Kakadu's demo applications and the `kdu_region_animator'
           object take the perspective that a playing animation should
           stop at a pause frame, but when a user re-enters the "play" mode,
           playback should commence from the first successive non-pause
           frame.  This also means that an animation which commences with
           one or more pause frames will skip over those frames when the
           "play" mode is first entered, but show them if the user steps
           through frames manually.  This behaviour is consistent with the
           standard and can be usefully exploited by content creators.

           Plays a similar role to `jpx_composition::get_instruction',

           [//]
           Each instruction refers to exactly one compositing layer,
           identified by `layer_idx'.  The frame is composed by applying
           the compositing layers corresponding to successive instructions
           (starting from `instruction_idx' 0) to an initially blank
           compositing surface.  Each compositing layer is applied to the
           region of the compositing surface expressed by `target_dims',
           where the location parameters in `target_dims.pos' must be
           non-negative.  This region is regenerated by re-orienting (as
           required) and then scaling (as required) the region of the source
           compositing layer described by `source_dims'.
         [RETURNS]
           True if `instruction_idx' lies in the range 0 to I-1, where I
           is the total number of instructions, as returned by `get_info'.
         [ARG: source_dims]
           Region to be cropped from the source composition layer to use
           in this instruction.  The `source_dims.pos' member identifies
           the location of the cropped region relative to the upper left
           hand corner of the image itself; its coordinates must be
           non-negative.  All coordinates are expressed on the compositing
           layer's registration grid.  For a description of the registration
           grid see `jpx_layer_source::get_codestream_registration'.
           [//]
           If `source_dims' has zero area, the source region is taken to be
           the whole of the source compositing layer.

           Region within the composition surface to which the `source_dims'
           region of the compositing layer is to be mapped, after applying
           any re-orientation returned via the `orientation' argument.
           Mapping to the `target_dims' region may involve some scaling.

           taken to be identical to `source_dims.size' (after any
           transposition identified by `orientation'), unless `source_dims'
           also has zero area, in which case the size of the target region

           This function may be used to identify the original instruction

           information is useful primarily for constructing JPIP
           "jpxl-context" requests (see `kdu_sampled_range::remapping_ids').
           [//]
           You should realize that the interpretation of the `iset_idx'
           and `inum_idx' values is dependent on the compositing layer
           that is associated with the instruction in question.  If
           that compositing layer is one of the file's top-level compositing
           layers, then `iset_idx' refers to an Instruction Set box within
           the top-level Composition box.  Otherwise, `iset_idx' refers to
           an Instruction Set box within the JPX Container (Compositing
           Layer Extensions box) which defines the compositing layer.

           False if `instruction_idx' is greater than or equal to the

           than 0.

           recovered, measured relative to the first instruction set box in
           the file's top-level Composition box, or the first instruction set
           box in the relevant Compositing Layer Extensions box, depending
           on where the associated compositing layer is defined.
         [ARG: inum_idx]
           Used to return the index of the specific instruction within
           the above-mentioned instruction set box, from which this frame
           instruction was recovered.  A value of 0 means that it was
           recovered from the first instruction in the instruction set box.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function can be used to recover an old-style opaque
           `jx_frame' reference and associated information that allows
           the frame's compositing instructions to be queried via the
           old-style `jpx_composition::get_instruction' function.
           [//]
           On entry, `instruction_offset' holds the index of one of the
           object's compositing instructions -- the number of these is
           returned by `get_info'.  The function returns the `jx_frame'
           reference to which this instruction belongs, along with the
           repetition instance (`instance_idx') associated with the frame.
           The function modifies the value of `instruction_idx' so that it
           can be used with `jpx_composition::get_instruction' to recover the
           same information that would be recovered by the current object's
           `get_instruction' function, when invoked with the original
           instruction index.
           [//]
           The above description is perhaps deceptively simple.  To use
           the `jx_frame' reference retained by this function, one needs
           first to recover an appropriate `jpx_composition' interface
           by invoking the static `jpx_composition::get_interface_for_frame'
           function.  After invoking `jpx_composition::get_instruction',
           the returned relative compositing layer index needs to be
           offset by `increment' * `instance_idx', where `increment'
           is the value returned by `jpx_composition::get_frame_info',
           and then passed to `jpx_composition::map_rel_layer_idx'.  All
           of these operations are performed automatically for you by the
           `jpx_frame::get_instruction' function.
           [//]
           It is worth mentioning that the returned `jx_frame' reference
           may depend upon the value of `instruction_idx' that is found
           on entry -- this is because the instruction indices provided
           to `jpx_frame::get_instruction' index the complete set of
           compositing instructions which contribute to a frame, including
           instructions which may belong to previous frames that were marked
           as persistent (unless the interface was created with the
           `include_persistents' flag disabled).
           [//]
           It is unlikely that an application will have cause to invoke
           this function directly; however, it is used internally by some
           Kakadu objects in order to offer both old-style and new-style
           methods for accessing compositing frames in a consistent manner.
         [RETURNS]
           NULL if `instruction_idx' does not correspond to a valid instruction
           or the current interface is empty.

class jpx_composition {
  /* [BIND: interface]
     [SYNOPSIS]
       Manages the information associated with the Composition box
       (box-type = `comp') which may be found in a JPX file.  At most
       one composition box may be found in a JPX file, describing
       the generation of composited and/or animated images from the various
       compositing layers; we also refer to this as the top-level
       Composition box.
       [//]
       Instances of this object may also be used to manage individual
       "presentation tracks" within JPX containers (see
       `jpx_target::add_container' or `jpx_source::get_container').  In
       this latter case, however, the compositing layer indices that are
       used to build up compositions must be understood relative to the
       collection of compositing layers that constitute the specific
       presentation track within its container.  The `map_rel_layer_idx'
       function is offered by the present function to map such relative
       compositing layer indices to absolute compositing layer indices
       and also to remind application developers of the existence of such
       a mapping.
       [//]
       From a file writer's perspective, this object provides an interface
       which is more natural than simply supplying or retrieving compositing
       instructions to or from the JPX composition box.  This means that the
       object may need to do quite a bit of work to make things look simple
       for you.  There are some ways to abuse this so that a seemingly simple
       animation ends up being extremely costly to encode into a JPX
       composition box.  The main thing to watch out for is that you should
       avoid describing animations in which the composition layers are played
       backwards.  The JPX composition box is designed with the idea of
       using layers one after the other, with possible re-use of layers at
       later points in the animation.  It is possible to describe animations
       in which the layers are played from the last one back to the first one,
       but such a description will not be efficient and may not be handled
       efficiently by some JPX readers (should not affect Kakadu readers, if
       they are based on the `kdu_region_compositor' object).
       [//]
       From a reader's perspective, the top level `jpx_composition' object
       obtained via `jpx_source::access_composition' provides you with all
       the machinery you need to recover frame counts and descriptions, not
       only for the file's top-level Composition box, but also for the global
       presentation tracks (also known as presentation threads) that may
       be offered by the appearance of compositing instructions within JPX
       containers (Compositing Layer Extensions boxes).  You should be aware
       of the fact that presentation track 0 refers exclusively to the
       sequence of composited frames that are based on the top-level
       composition box, whereas all other track indices correspond to the
       augmented sequences of frames offered by concatenating the top-level
       frames with those described within JPX containers -- these tracks
       are known as "global presentation tracks".
       [//]
       Prior to KDU7.2, the only way to access composition information was
       via the opaque `jx_frame' references returned by `get_next_frame'
       and `get_prev_frame'.  These can still be used, but their correct
       use becomes more tricky in cases where frames are drawn from global
       presentation tracks -- this is partly because compositing layer
       references are interpreted relative to the specific `jpx_composition'
       interface with which the `jx_frame' reference is associated and they
       generally need to be remapped using that object's
       `map_rel_layer_idx' function.  It is still possible to use the
       opaque frame references correctly, even within global presentation
       tracks, but you may need to use the `access_owner' function
       to recover the `jpx_composition' interface that the frame reference
       belongs to.

           If `global_only' is false (default), this function counts the
           number of distinct presentation tracks in the source, setting
           `count' to 0 only if the source provides no animation instructions
           whatsoever.  If multiple presentation tracks (a.k.a. presentation
           threads) are defined by any JPX container (Compositing Layer

           of presentation tracks that are defined by any such JPX container.
           [//]
           If `global_only' is true, the function counts the number of

           might be larger if the function is called in the future.  If
           this happens, the function returns false, but still sets `count'

    KDU_AUX_EXPORT bool count_track_frames(kdu_uint32 track_idx, int &count);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Similar to `count_tracks', this function counts the number of
           frames which belong to a given presentation track.  Note that
           `track_idx'=0 identifies the sequence of animation frames
           associated exclusively with the file's unique top-level
           Composition box.  Positive values of `track_idx' refer to
           so-called "global presentation tracks (or threads)" that are
           formed by concatenating relevant instructions from JPX containers
           (Compositing Layer Extensions boxes) with those from the top-level
           Composition box.  The total number of these "global presentation
           tracks", T, is the `count' value returned by the `count_tracks'
           function.  This means that `track_idx' values in the range 1 to
           T refer to distinct global 
           presentation tracks, each of which
           may yield a different frame count -- although different frame
           counts can occur only if the INFO sub-box of the final

           count unspecified and the number of different presentation tracks

           If `track_idx' is greater than the track count, T, this function
           returns the frame count for the final presentation track.  This
           is consistent with the convention that the last collection of
           compositing instructions defined within a Compositing Layer
           Extensions box (JPX container) belong not only to the associated
           global presentation track, but to all later presentation tracks
           also -- see `access_frame' and `jpx_frame::get_track_idx' for
           more on this convention.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Use this function to recover an interface to a specific frame
           within the sequence of animated display frames for a specific
           presentation track (a.k.a. presentation thread).  As with other
           functions that accept a presentation track index, the `track_idx'
           argument is either 0 or else a "global presentation track" index
           in the range 1 to T, where T is the count returned via
           `count_tracks'.
           [//]
           It is important to understand the notion of track compatibility.
           Presentation tracks thread their way through the frames defined
           by the top-level Composition box and then through each of the
           JPX containers (Compositing Layer Extensions boxes) that offer
           compositing instructions.  The top-level Composition box and each
           JPX container with compositing instructions represents a
           context for each presentation track.  The first (top-level) context
           defines frames for `track_idx'=0, but is considered a prefix for
           all global presentation tracks; thus, frames from this first
           context are compatible with any valid `track_idx'.  Each
           successive context C defines frames for global presentation
           tracks with `track_idx' values T=1 thorugh T=T_C, where T_C
           is the number of distinct collections of compositing instructions
           defined within the Compositing Layer Extensions box.  However,
           the frames defined for the last track T=T_C in the context are
           considered also to belong to all later presentation tracks.
           [//]
           Although the number of distinct presentation tracks is limited,
           and may be recovered using `count_tracks', this function does
           not impose any upper bound on the `track_idx' values that can
           be supplied.  This is consistent with the idea that the last
           track defined in any given context is compatible with all larger
           track indices.
           [//]
           Important consequences of the above conventions are:
           [>>] Frames defined by the top-level Composition box can be
                returned for any value of `track_idx' whatsoever.
           [>>] Only those frames defined by the top-level Composition box
                can be returned if `track_idx'=0.
           [>>] All frames associated with the first global presentation
                thread can be returned if `track_idx'=1.
           [>>] All frames associated with the last global presentation
                thread can be returned if `track_idx' is greater than or
                equal to the number of tracks returned by `count_tracks'.
           [//]
           If `frame_idx' is less than 0 or greater than or equal to
           the number of frames that can be considered consistent with
           the track identified by `track_idx', the function returns
           an empty interface.  However, in cases where the ultimate
           `jp2_family_src' data source is fueled by a dynamic cache, it
           may happen that the function can return a non-empty interface
           for a frame whose existence cannot yet be confirmed, so long as
           `must_exist' is false.  This can happen in only two circumstances:
           [>>] It may happen if `track_idx'=0 and the number of top-level
                compositing layers in the file cannot yet be ascertained --
                the top-level Composition box's frames (track-0) are
                limited by what can be constructed using only top-level
                compositing layers and it may be that a frame returned by
                this function uses a top-level compositing layer whose
                existence cannot yet be confirmed or denied.  This situation
                does not occur if `track_idx' > 0 since in that case a
                non-empty return requires confirmation of the existence of
                global presentation threads, which means that at least one
                Compositing Layer Extensions box must have been found, and
                this in turn means that all top-level compositing layers
                must have already been found.
           [>>] It may happen if `frame_idx' refers to a composited frame
                that is formed from compositing instructions within a final
                Compositing Layer Extensions box that has an indefinite
                repetition factor, along with an unspecified number of
                contributed frames.  In this case, the number of frames
                may depend on the number of Contiguous Codestreams or
                Fragment Tables that are encountered, and these may become
                available progressively -- perhaps even as content is
                generated dynamically (e.g., from a camera).  It can happen
                then that the function returns a non-empty interface in
                response to a request for such a frame (only if `must_exist'
                is false, though), before the existence of the frame can
                be confirmed.
           [//]
           The reason for offering the possibility of returning frames whose
           existence cannot yet be confirmed is that the returned `jpx_frame'
           interface can be used to determine the compositing layers upon
           which the frame's existence depends.  An application may choose to
           form a JPIP query for these compositing layers, for example, so
           that their existence (or lack thereof) can be discovered after
           the contents of the dynamic cache have grown to accommodate the
           JPIP server's response.       
           [//]
           This function is intended for use with composition objects obtained
           via `jpx_source::access_composition'.  In all other circumstances,
           an empty interface will be returned.
         [RETURNS]
           An empty interface if the requested `frame_idx' cannot be
           considered compatible with the requested `track_idx', following
           the conventions outlined above.  Also, if the requested frame
           does not exist, or cannot yet be confirmed to exist (when
           `must_exist' is true), the function returns an empty interface.
           [//]
           An empty interface is also returned if the function is invoked on
           any interface not obtained via `jpx_source::access_composition'.
         [ARG: track_idx]
           See detailed notes above, regarding top-level and JPX container
           contexts and track compatibility.  In particular, `track_idx'=0
           is compatible only with frames defined by the top-level Composition
           box, but those frames are also compatible with any `track_idx',
           while any non-zero `track_idx' value is guaranteed to be compatible
           with some global presentation thread, unless there are none.
         [ARG: frame_idx]
           Valid frame indices start from 0, corresponding to the first
           animation frame produced by the top-level composition box -- this
           is true for all tracks.
         [ARG: must_exist]
           If true, this function returns an empty interface
           unless it can confirm the existence of the requested frame.  In
           this case, the application may find it useful to invoke
           `count_track_frames' to determine how many frames are actually
           known to exist and whether or not this knowledge might change
           in the future.
           [//]
           One way to provoke a JPIP server into sending sufficient
           information for a frame's existence to become apparent is to
           send a special "jpxf-context-range" request to the server.
           However, such requests might not be understood by all servers.
           Another, more primitive mechanism, is to send "jpxl-context-range"
           requests for the relevant compositing layers.  This method requires
           that you know what compositing layers would be used by the frame
           if it did exist.  To learn this information, you can invoke this
           function with the `must_exist' argument set to false.
           [//]
           You should be aware, however, that this function may return an
           empty interface even if the frame does potentially exist and
           `must_exist' is false, if the function is unable to read sufficient
           information from a dynamic cache to discover the frame's
           compositing instructions.  To ensure that such a situation does
           not persist indefinitely, it is a good idea to augment JPIP
           requests with a metadata request for all boxes with the box-type
           `jp2_comp_instruction_set_4cc'.  This can be done using the
           convenient `jpx_source::generate_metareq' function.
         [ARG: include_persistents]
           In most cases, you should leave this argument equal to its
           default value (true).  In this case, the returned `jpx_frame'
           interface is configured to automatically fold all previous
           frames that are marked as persistent into the set of instructions
           returned by `jpx_frame::get_instruction' and enumerated by
           `jpx_frame::get_info'.  The only reason for setting this argument
           to false is if intend to buffer up the composited results
           produced by persistent frames and reuse them in the future.  The
           `jpx_frame::is_persistent' function can be used to determine
           whether or not a frame is persistent (and hence might need to
           be buffered up in such an application).

           This function is used for discovering compositing frames
           that are associated with any (or all -- see `flags') of
           a collection of compositing layers.
           [//]
           The function is easiest to understand if we begin with the
           case in which `flags' is 0 and `frame' is an empty interface on
           entry.  In this case, the function finds the first frame (if any)
           within the presentation track given by `track_idx', such that the
           frame uses at least one (or all -- see `flags') of the `num_layers'
           compositing layers whose indices appear in the `layers' array.
           If a match is found, the function returns 1, setting `frame' and
           `inst_idx' to identify the matching frame and the first matching
           compositing instruction within that frame.
           [//]
           It is not necessary for `track_idx' to be a valid track index,
           since a frame that is found within the final presentation track
           of a context that has only T tracks is considered compatible
           with all `track_idx' values that are >= T.  See
           `access_frame' or `jpx_frame::get_track_idx' for more on this.
           [//]
           If the `frame' interface is non-empty on entry, the function
           starts its search from the supplied `frame' (inclusive), rather
           than the start of the track.
           [//]
           If the `JPX_FRAME_MATCH_LATER_TRACKS' flag is present, the
           function looks for matches that are compatible with any track
           T >= `track_idx'.  In this case, the function walks through
           contexts one by one, where the first context corresponds to
           the top-level Composition box and subsequent contexts correspond
           to JPX containers, looking for the first track T >= `track_idx'
           that contains any of the compositing layers identified by the
           `layer_indices' array and finding the first matching frame within
           that track.  If `frame' is a non-empty interface on entry, the
           behaviour is the same as that described above, except that
           if the supplied `frame' belongs to an earlier presentation
           track than `track_idx' or if no match can be found within the
           same presentation track and the same context as `frame', the
           function considers later presentation tracks within the same
           context.  This behaviour is designed to ensure that you can
           use this function together with `jpx_frame::access_next'
           to enumerate all matches in the manner suggested below.
           [//]
           If the `JPX_FRAME_MATCH_REVERSE' flag is present, the search
           works backwards rather than forwards.  In this case, if
           `frame' is an empty interface on entry, the search starts from
           the last JPX container, if any, looking for the last animation
           frame in the first presentation track which can match the supplied
           compositing layers.  If `frame' is a non-empty interface on entry,
           the search starts from the initial frame (inclusive) as usual,
           but that frame is not a match, the function considers earlier
           rather than later frames.
           [//]
           If `container_id' is non-negative, any layer indices within the
           `layers' array that correspond to base compositing layers for
           the corresponding container are interpreted as matching any
           frame within the container that uses the base layer or any of
           its repetitions.  See `jpx_container_source::get_base_layers'
           for more on JPX container's, base compositing layers and
           repetitions.  As it turns out, this makes no difference to the
           behaviour of the function if `match_or_exceed_existing_frame' is
           false, since the first matching frame will always be the one that
           uses the base layer.  The feature is important only for walking
           through the complete collection of matching frames.
           [//]
           It is worth explaining the best way to use this function to
           walk through the most natural sequence of matching frames from
           a single auto-discovered presentation track.  To do this, set up
           two state variables, T and L, where T is the minimum track index
           that is consistent with the entire sequence of discovered frames
           and L indicates (true or false) whether or not all frames discovered
           so far belong to the last track within their context -- this is
           explained with `jpx_frame::get_track_idx'.
           [>>] Start by initializing T=0, L=true and calling the function
                with an empty `frame' interface, `track_idx'=0 and with the
                `JPX_FRAME_MATCH_LATER_TRACKS' flag.
           [>>] After each successive `frame' is discovered, do
                Tf = frame.get_track_idx(Lf) and set T = max{T, Tf} and
                L = L && Lf.  Then pass `frame.access_next' into the next
                call to this function, along with `track_idx'=T and
                include the `JPX_FRAME_MATCH_LATER_TRACKS' flag only if
                L is still true.  It is recommended that if Tf=0 is
                returned by `frame.get_track_idx' you modify the value
                used for Tf to 1 in this algorithm, so that the enumeration
                does not get stuck within those frames defined by the
                top-level Composition box only.
           [//]
           Once you have finished walking through all matching frames of the
           first most natural matching track, using the above sequence of
           calls, the T state variable will hold the index of that track.
           If L is still true, there are no more matches.  However, if L is
           false, there may be other matching tracks, so you can start the
           whole process again, initializing T with T+1 instead of 0 this
           time, and restoring the L state variable to true.
           [//]
           There are, of course, other ways to use this function, one of which
           is to walk through the track indices one by one in an outer loop,
           enumerating all frames that match the layer specifications and
           belong to the relevant track in an inner loop; however, such an
           approach may return frames in an unusual order, if the set of
           compositing layers to be matched intersects with multiple JPX
           containers and each container defines a different number of unique
           presentation tracks -- of course, these are probably highly
           pathalogical cases.
           [//]
           This function is intended for use with composition objects obtained
           via `jpx_source::access_composition'.  In all other circumstances,
           the function returns -1.
         [RETURNS]
           1 if a match was found.  Otherwise, the function returns -1 if
           no match will ever be found, or 0 if the existence or identity
           of a match cannot yet be determined.  If the return value is
           non-positive, `frame' and `inst_idx' values are left untouched.
         [ARG: frame]
           If non-empty on entry, this argument supplies a starting point
           for the search for matching frames.
           [//]
           If the function returns 1 (success), the `frame' interface is
           configured to represent the matching frame.  Note that the way
           in which `frame' is configured depends upon the
           `include_persistents' argument, whereas the way in which a
           non-empty `frame' interface is interpreted on entry does not
           depend upon `include_persistents'.  As a result, it can happen
           that the matching frame is the same as the one supplied on entry,
           but the `frame' interface is modified for consistency with the
           `include_persistents' convention.
         [ARG: inst_idx]
           Used to return the index of the first compositing instruction in
           the matching animation frame, which uses one of the compositing
           layers identified within the `layers' array.  To determine the
           identity of the matching compositing layer, you can invoke
           `frame.get_instruction' with the instruction index round in
           `inst_idx'.
         [ARG: track_idx]
           Track index with which any matching frame must be compatible,
           unless the `JPX_FRAME_MATCH_LATER_TRACKS' flag is present, in which
           case a matching frame may be consistent with this or any later
           track.  In any event, if `frame' was non-empty on entry, any
           matching frame must be compatible with the same track as this
           initial frame.  Bear in mind that frames which belong to the
           last track in their context are always compatible with higher
           track indices -- see `jpx_frame::get_track_idx'.
         [ARG: layers]
           If NULL, the function invariably matches nothing, returning -1.
           Otherwise, this array must have at least `num_layers' elements.
         [ARG: num_layers]
           Number of candidate compositing layer indices to match.  If less
           than 1, the function invariably matches nothing, returning -1.
         [ARG: container_id]
           Identifier of any JPX container for which one or more of the
           indices in `layers' might be base compositing layer indices.  See
           `jpx_source::access_container' for more on JPX containers and
           their identifiers.
         [ARG: include_persistents]
           This argument affects the way in which the `frame' interface is
           configured upon a successful return.  Its interpretation is
           identical to its namesake in the `access_frame' function.  The
           argument also affects the interpretetation of the value returned
           via `inst_idx', since the inclusion of persistent previous frames
           within the scope of a `jpx_frame' interface means that instruction
           indices start from the first instruction in the first such
           persistent frame.
           [//]
           Note that this argument has no impact on the matching process
           itself -- that is, a frame is not considered to match the supplied
           compositing layer indices just because it has previous persistent
           frames within which there is a match.  This argument has
           no impact on the implementation complexity either.
         [ARG: flags] Any or all of the following are currently recognized:
           [>>] `JPX_FRAME_MATCH_ALL_LAYERS' -- if present, the function only
                returns successfully if it finds a frame whose compositing
                instructions use all of the compositing layers whose indices
                appear in the `layer_indices' array.  Note, however, that this
                flag is ignored if `container_id' is non-negative and any of
                the compositing layers is one of the associated JPX container's
                base layers.  This exclusion is important, since these layers
                are effectively replicated into a large (potentially
                unbounded) collection of layers to match.
           [>>] `JPX_FRAME_MATCH_LATER_TRACKS' -- as explained above, this
                extends the match to frames that are compatible with any
                presentation track index T >= `track_idx' rather than just
                T = `track_idx'.
           [>>] `JPX_FRAME_MATCH_REVERSE' -- as explained above, this flag
                causes the matching machinery to start at the end of the
                available animation frames (unless `frame' is non-empty on
                entry, in which case we start from the supplied frame as
                usual) and walk backwards rather than forwards.

           Same as `find_layer_match' function, except in the following
           respects:
           [>>] The set of compositing layer indices to match are those
                returned by `numlist.get_numlist_layers', with the
                `container_id' argument to `find_layer_match' being obtained
                using `numlist.get_container_id'.  This means that the
                function automatically implements the JPX container
                replication rules for compositing layer indices (see
                `numlist.get_container_lmap') when looking for matching frames.
           [>>] In the special case where `numlist' contains no references to
                compositing layers, but does contain one or more references to
                codestreams, if `num_inferred_layers' > 0, the
                function attempts to infer a set of compositing layers that
                should be of interest by using `jpx_source::access_codestream'
                and `jpx_codestream_source::enum_layer_ids'.  In this case,
                any `JPX_FRAME_MATCH_ALL_LAYERS' flag is ignored (removed
                before passing `flags' on to the internal call to
                `find_layer_match' that is supplied with the inferred
                compositing layer indices).  Moreover, in
                this case, you should be aware that the set of inferred
                compositing layers might not be complete, either because the
                limit set by `max_inferred_layers' is too small, or because
                the ultimate `jp2_family_src' data source is fuelled by a
                dynamic cache that is missing some compositing layer headers.

           This function is intended for use with composition objects obtained

           If this argument is an empty interface or one for which
           `numlist.get_numlist_info' returns false, the function does nothing,
           returning -1.  Also, it the number list has no references to
           compositing layers, the function immediately returns -1 unless
           `max_inferred_layers' > 0 and the number list contains references
           to one or more codestreams.
         [ARG: max_inferred_layers]
           Ignored unless `numlist' contains only codestream references.  In
           this case, `max_inferred_layers' is the maximum number of
           compositing layer indices that the function will try to discover
           from the codestreams, passing these layer indices in the internal
           call to `find_layer_match'.

           uses non-existent compositing layers.
         [ARG: frame]
           The `frame' argument actually need not be a reference that is
           owned by this particular `jpx_composition' interface -- this
           function, `access_owner' and `get_frame_info' are the only
           functions that have this property.
         [ARG: iteration_idx]
           Must be in the range 0 to R, where R is the `repeat_count' value
           returned by `get_frame_info', unless `repeat_count' is -ve
           (unbounded), in which case `iteration_idx' may take any
           non-negative value.  If not, an empty interface will be returned.
         [ARG: include_persistents]
           Same interpretation as the same argument to `access_frame'.  In
           most cases, you should keep the default value (true) for this
           flag.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           The opaque `frame_ref' pointer may have been obtained by a
           previous call to `get_next_frame', `get_prev_frame', or
           `get_last_persistent_frame'.  If `frame_ref' is NULL, the

           This function does allow `frame_ref' to be one of the opaque
           frame references that is managed by a different `jpx_composition'
           interface -- only `access_owner', `get_interface_for_frame' and
           this function have this property.  You cannot recover any of
           the frame's compositing instructions via `get_instruction', for
           example, unless that function is invoked on the `jpx_composition'
           interface that owns `frame-ref'.
           [//]
           Returns overview information concerning a single "frame".  As
           noted with `get_next_frame', the opaque `jx_frame' reference
           type actually refers to a potentially larger collection of
           physical display frames that may be formed by repeating
           instructions; the `repeat_count' argument is used to identify
           whether or not this is the case.  By contrast, the `jpx_frame'
           interface returned via `access_frame' describes exactly one
           physical display frame.
           [//]
           Repetition does not mean that exactly the same composited image
           is played over and over again.  Instead, the compositing layer
           indices associated with compositing instructions in the frame may
           need to be incremented between successive display frames that
           are generated by a single `jx_frame' "frames".
           [//]
           Each frame consists of a sequence of compositing instructions
           which must be performed in order to build up a single composited
           image.  Consecutive frames represent distinct composited images
           to be displayed at distinct time instants.
           [//]
           It is worth noting the special case in which the `duration'
           is 0.  This corresponds to a `LIFE' value of 0x7FFFFFFF encountered
           within the relevant instruction in the JPX Composition box (or
           within a Compositing Layer Extensions box).  The standard
           (IS15444-2) states that in this case, the frame should
           be treated as a "Pause" instruction during animation playback.
           Kakadu's demo applications and the `kdu_region_animator' object
           take the perspective that a playing animation should stop at
           a pause frame, but when a user re-enters the "play" mode,
           playback should commence from the first successive non-pause
           frame.  This also means that an animation which commences with
           one or more pause frames will skip over those frames when the
           "play" mode is first entered, but show them if the user steps
           through frames manually.  This behaviour is consistent with
           the standard and can be usefully exploited by content creators.
         [ARG: num_instructions]
           Used to return the number of compositing instructions used to
           compose the current frame.  Use `get_instruction' to examine the
           details of each instruction.
         [ARG: duration]
           Used to return the number of milliseconds between this frame and
           the next.
           [>>]
           Note that the special value of 0 is used to represent frames whose
           final JPX animation instruction has a `LIFE' parameter equal to
           0x7FFFFFFF As explained above, these are to be interpreted as
           "pause" frames.
         [ARG: repeat_count]
           Used to return the number of times (in addition to the first time)
           which the frame should be repeated.  If 0, the frame is not
           repeated.  If negative, the frame is repeated indefinitely.
           Repeated frames are separated by `duration' milliseconds.  Repeated
           frames do not necessarily use the same compositing layers in their
           instructions.  See `get_instruction' for more on the adjustment of
           compositing layer indices between repeatitions of a frame.
         [ARG: is_persistent]
           Used to return an indication of whether or not the effects of
           compositing this frame should be used as a background for all
           future composition operations.  To render any given frame, one
           must compose all preceding persistent frames in sequence, followed
           by the frame of interest.
           [//]
           Although this seems like a simple idea, in some circumstances
           (e.g., dynamic region-of-interest rendering) it can create an
           enormous amount of work.  For this reason, persistent frames are
           best avoided.  The `kdu_region_compositor' object goes to a lot
           of effort to figure out which persistent frames are actually
           visible (i.e., not completely covered by new opaque layers) so as
           to avoid composing hundreds or thousands of layers together where
           frame persistence has been misused.  Unfortunately, the visibility
           of persistent frames in later frames cannot properly be figured
           out within the `kdu_composition' object, since composition
           information (e.g., to figure out which layers are needed) may be
           required before the opacity of compositing layers has become
           available from a dynamic cache.

    KDU_AUX_EXPORT jx_frame *
      get_last_persistent_frame(jx_frame *frame_ref) const;
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Returns a reference to the most recent "frame", preceding that
           referenced by the opaque `frame_ref' pointer, which is marked as
           persistent.  By following last persistent frame links, it is
           possible to walk backwards through the list of frames which
           must notionally be composed onto the composition surface prior
           to the current frame.  Invoking `get_frame_info' on each of these
           frames will cause the supplied `is_persistent' argument to be set
           to true.
           [//]
           This function enables dynamic renderers such as that embodied by
           `kdu_region_compositor' to efficiently scan through the
           compositing dependencies, stopping as soon as it encounters a
           complete opaque background.
           [//]
           The opaque `frame_ref' pointer may have been obtained by a
           previous call to `get_next_frame', `get_prev_frame', or
           `get_last_persistent_frame'.  If `frame_ref' is NULL or
           is managed by a different `jpx_composition' interface
           to this one, this function returns NULL; however, you can use
           `access_owner' to discover the `jpx_composition'
           interface to which it does belongs.
           [//]
           You should be aware that the `jx_frame' reference returned by
           this function may actually belong to a different `jpx_composition'
           interface -- this can happen if the current interface was obtained
           using `jpx_container_source::access_presentation_track'.  For
           this reason, the returned opaque frame reference should not
           be used without first discovering its `jpx_composition' interface
           via `access_owner'.
           [//]
           If the returned `jx_frame' reference has a non-zero repeat count,
           as returned by `get_frame_info', the persistent frame is actually
           the last repeated instance.  However, you should be aware that in
           the special case where the returned `jx_frame' belongs to the
           top-level Composition box and the supplied `frame_ref' belongs to
           a JPX container, the last repeated instance associated with the
           returned `jx_frame' reference might not actually be a valid
           composited frame (this is because top-level composition frames
           are limited to using only top-level compositing layers from the
           file).  In this case, you may need to use an earlier instance of
           the repeated persistent frame -- the last one that uses only
           top-level compositing layers.  This is an unusual situation, but
           one that can exist in a legal JPX file.
           [//]
           In view of the potential programming pitfalls mentioned above,
           you are strongly recommended to use `jpx_frame' interfaces
           (see `access_frame') instead of opaque frame references.
           The `jpx_frame' interface is able to automatically incorporate
           all previous persistent frames, allowing access to
           their properties as a single unit, without the need to discover
           the owning `jpx_compositor' object via `access_owner' or
           explicitly account for the possibilities described above.  If some
           part of an application must use the old-style opaque frame
           references for some reason (e.g., to avoid rewriting code that
           was written for versions of the Kakadu SDK prior to 7.2), you
           should consider using `jpx_frame::get_old_ref' to derive suitable
           `jx_frame' references, repetition instances and instruction indices
           from a `jpx_frame' interface.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           The JPX Composition box, as well as the presentation tracks within
           JPX Compositing Layer Extensions boxes, are built from collections
           of instructions which each either add to the composition associated
           with the previous instruction or commence from scratch with a new
           composition surface.  Each instruction also has its own timing.
           These aspects are untangled here to create a set of distinct
           frames, each of which has its own set of compositing layers.
           [//]
           Each frame is composed by applying each of its compositing layers
           in turn to an initially blank compositing surface.  Each
           compositing layer is applied to the region of the compositing
           surface expressed by `target_dims', where the location parameters
           in `target_dims.pos' must be non-negative.  This region is
           generated by re-orienting (as required) and then scaling (as
           required) the region of the source compositing layer described by
           `source_dims'.
           [//]
           Each instruction refers to exactly one compositing layer.  For
           the top-level `jpx_composition' object retrieved via
           `jpx_source::access_composition' this is a top-level compositing
           layer whose absolute index is identified via the `rel_layer_idx'
           argument, except that each time the frame is repeated (if the
           `repeat_count' returned by `get_next_frame' is non-zero), the
           layer index must be augmented by `rel_increment' (might be 0).
           [//]
           If the `jpx_composition' object describes a presentation track
           within a specific JPX container (i.e., this interface has been
           obtained via `jpx_container_source::access_presentation_track' or
           `jpx_container_target::add_presentation_track'), then the
           compositing layer index obtained via `rel_layer_idx' and
           augmented by the appropriate multiple of `rel_increment' is
           actually a "relative index" Lr.  To convert this relative index
           into an absolute compositing layer index, you should use the
           `map_rel_layer_idx' function.  By contrast, the compositing
           layer indices retrieved via the `jpx_frame' interface are
           absolute -- another reason to use `access_frame' and the
           methods of `jpx_frame' in place of the more primitive
           mechanisms that are connected with the opaque `jx_frame'
           reference.
           [//]
           Any frame repetition stops immediately if the relative layer index
           reaches or exceeds the number of compositing layers that are
           available to the `jpx_composition' object, which is conveniently
           identified by the `map_rel_layer_idx' function returning a
           negative value.
         [RETURNS]
           False if `instruction_idx' is < 0 or greater than or equal to the
           `num_instructions' value returned via `get_frame_info', or if
           `frame_ref' does not refer to a frame that is managed by this
           interface.
         [ARG: frame_ref]
           This argument is expected to provide one of the
           opaque frame references that is managed by this particular
           interface, as opposed to another `jpx_composition' interface.
           If it does not, the present function will return false
           immediately.
           [//]
           The only functions offered by `jpx_composition' that can be
           meaningfully passed a `jx_frame' reference that belongs to
           another `jpx_composition' interface are `access_owner',
           `get_frame_info' and `get_interface_for_frame'.
         [ARG: instruction_idx]
           0 retrieves the first instruction in the frame.  Each successive
           instruction is retrieved using consecutive instruction indices,
           up to L-1, where L is the number of instructions returned
           by `get_next_frame'.
         [ARG: rel_layer_idx]
           Used to return the (relative) index of the compositing layer
           (starting from 0 for the first one in the JPX data source) to be
           used with this instruction.
         [ARG: rel_increment]
           Amount to be added to `rel_layer_idx' each time the frame is
           repeated.  We are not referring here to global looping, as
           identified by the loop counter returned by `get_global_info'.
           We are referring only to repetitions of the frame, as identified by
           the `repeat_count' value retrieved using `get_next_frame'.
         [ARG: is_reused]
           Used to retrieve a boolean flag indicating whether or not the
           compositing layer associated with this instruction will be reused
           in any subsequent instruction in this or a future frame.  This
           can be useful for cache optimization.
         [ARG: source_dims]
           Region to be cropped from the source composition layer to use
           in this instruction.  The `source_dims.pos' member identifies
           the location of the cropped region relative to the upper left
           hand corner of the image itself; its coordinates must be
           non-negative.  All coordinates are expressed on the compositing
           layer's registration grid.  For a description of the registration
           grid see `jpx_layer_source::get_codestream_registration'.
           [//]
           If `source_dims' has zero area, the source region is taken to be
           the whole of the source compositing layer.
         [ARG: target_dims]
           Region within the composition surface to which the `source_dims'
           region of the compositing layer is to be mapped, after applying
           any re-orientation returned via the `orientation' argument.
           Mapping to the `target_dims' region may involve some scaling.
           [//]
           If `target_dims' has zero area, the size of the target region is
           taken to be identical to `source_dims.size' (after any
           transposition identified by `orientation'), unless `source_dims'
           also has zero area, in which case the size of the target region
           is taken to be identical to the size of the source compositing
           layer (after any transposition identified by `orientation').

           or `jpx_target::access_composition', has access only to top-level
           compositing layers (those retrieved by `jpx_source::access_layer'

           layer mapping is performed for you automatically.

      add_frame(int duration, int repeat_count, bool is_persistent);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Use this function to add a frame, specifying the number of
           milliseconds (`duration') until the next frame (if any) is to
           be started.  You must call this function at least once to cause
           a composition box to be written into the JPX file being generated
           by the `jpx_target' object which supplied the present interface.
           [//]
           Each frame can be repeated to create simple animations or movies.
           To make more sophisticated animations, you may need to explicitly
           add multiple frames.  Where a frame is repeated, the layer indices
           associated with the compositing layers within each frame may
           either remain fixed, or be advanced in a regular fashion.  For
           more on this, see `add_instruction'.
           [//]
           You must add at least one instruction to each new frame which
           you create.
           [//]
           You should be aware of the special significance associated with
           a `duration' of 0.  Frames with zero duration are to be treated
           as "pause" frames by players.  They are actually recorded in
           the JPX composition box by setting the `LIFE' parameter of the
           final JPX composition instruction in the frame to 0x7FFFFFFF, which
           is described in the standard (IS15444-2) as an instruction for
           a player to pause the animation and wait for user input.
           Kakadu's demo applications and the `kdu_region_animator' object
           take the perspective that a playing animation should stop at
           a pause frame, but when a user re-enters the "play" mode,
           playback should commence from the first successive non-pause
           frame.  This also means that an animation which commences with
           one or more pause frames will skip over those frames when the
           "play" mode is first entered, but show them if the user steps
           through frames manually.  This behaviour is consistent with
           the standard and can be usefully exploited by content creators.
         [RETURNS]
           An opaque pointer which should be passed to `add_instruction'
           to define the individual compositing layers which will constitute
           the frame.
         [ARG: duration]
           Time between this frame and the next, measured in milliseconds.
           If the frame is repeated, this is the time between the repetitions
           and the time between the last repetition and any frame which
           follows.
           [//]
           Note that the special value of 0 is used to represent frames whose
           final JPX animation instruction is assigned a `LIFE' parameter
           equal to 0x7FFFFFFF.  As explained above, these are to be
           interpreted as pause frames.
         [ARG: repeat_count]
           If 0, the frame is not repeated.  Otherwise, this is the number
           of times the frame is to be repeated.  A negative value means
           that the frame should be repeated indefinitely.  This only
           makes sense for the last frame to be added.
         [ARG: is_persistent]
           If true, the compositing instructions in this frame contribute
           to a background composition which is to be used by all subsequent
           frames.  Otherwise, the instructions in this frame contribute
           only to the rendering of the frame itself.
           [//]
           Although persistent frames sound like a good idea, you should
           try to avoid them.  One reason for this is that they make it
           difficult for a player to start from an arbitrary frame in the
           sequence.  Another more insidious reason is that persistent
           frames make it difficult to implement quality progressive
           compositions or dynamic rendering of regions of interest within
           a large composed image which cannot be fully stored in a buffer.
           The `kdu_region_compositor' object goes to a lot of effort to
           figure out which persistent frames can be ignored in such a
           rendering process, but it is far better as a content creator to
           simply avoid the use of persistent frames, or to use only a
           single persistent background frame.

           The sequence number (starting from 0) of the instruction being
           added.
         [ARG: frame_ref]
           Opaque pointer returned by `add_frame'.
         [ARG: rel_layer_idx]
           Each instruction refers to exactly one compositing layer.  For
           the top-level `jpx_composition' object retrieved via
           `jpx_source::access_composition' this is a top-level compositing
           layer whose absolute index is identified by `rel_layer_idx',
           except that each time the frame is repeated (if the
           `repeat_count' returned by `get_next_frame' is non-zero), the
           layer index must be augmented by `rel_increment' (might be 0).
           [//]
           If the `jpx_composition' object describes a presentation track
           within a specific JPX container (i.e., this interface has been
           obtained via `jpx_container_target::add_presentation_track'),
           then the compositing layer index obtained via `rel_layer_idx' and
           augmented by the appropriate multiple of `rel_increment' is
           actually a "relative index" Lr.  To convert this relative index
           into an absolute compositing layer index, you should use the
           `map_rel_layer_idx' function.
         [ARG: rel_increment]
           Ignored unless the frame is repeated.  Each time the frame is
           repeated (see `repeat_count' argument to `add_frame'), the
           relative layer index (see `rel_layer_idx') is incremented by this
           value.
           [//]
           Frame repetition stops immediately if the relative layer
           index reaches or exceeds the number of compositing layers that
           are available to the `jpx_composition' object; this is the total
           number of top-level compositing layers if the present object is
           the one obtained via `jpx_target::access_composition'.  Otherwise,
           it is the number of compositing layers available to the relevant
           presentation track within its JPX container, as explained in
           connection with `jpx_container_target::add_presentation_track'.
           In any event, when this happens the `map_rel_layer_idx' function
           will return a negative value.
           [//]       
           As an example, you might like to build a composite animation from
           a consecutive sequence of layers (`rel_increment'=1) which are
           composed onto a fixed background layer (`rel_increment'=0).
           [//]
           Note that there can be some weird sequences of layer increments
           which the internal machinery will not be able to represent
           efficiently.  As a general rule, you should try to use only
           positive and zero-valued increments (although negative increments
           are not forbidden) and you should try to use the same increments
           for all instructions in the frame.
         [ARG: source_dims]
           Specifies the cropped region within the compositing layer
           which is to be used by this instruction.  The region is
           expressed on the compositing layer's registration grid, as
           described with `jpx_layer_target::set_codestream_registration'.
         [ARG: target_dims]
           Specifies the region on the composition surface to which the
           cropped source region should be rendered.  This may involve
           some scaling.
         [ARG: orient]
           Specifies how the (potentially cropped) source image is to be
           re-oriented prior to any scaling and translation required to map
           it to the `target_dims' region.  Supported orientations include
           rotations by multiples of 90 degrees and flipping.

           This function resets the object to the empty state and then
           proceeds to add instructions from the supplied frame, starting
           from the last instruction (the one whose compositing layer will
           be painted on top of all the others) and working backwards (toward
           the background).  Each instruction contributes a single member,
           returned via `get_members', except for any instruction which is
           known to have no impact on the region of interest.  If the
           `region_of_interest' argument supplies an empty region, the
           region of interest is taken to be the entire composition
           surface.  In any event, an instruction has no impact on the region
           of interest if all imagery which it composits within that region
           lies underneath an existing opaque image region.
           [//]
           Note that it may not be possible to determine the opacity (or even
           size) of potential covering imagery if the relevant compositing
           layers are not yet accessible.
           [//]
           We say that a compositing layer is "not yet accessible" if the
           JPX data source is fueled by a dynamic cache which does not yet
           have sufficient contents to successfully access the layer using
           `jpx_source::access_layer'.  To clarify this important concept,
           we make the following two points:
           [>>] If we are able to determine that a relevant layer lies
                outside the range of compositing layers which can ever exist
                in the data source, we DO NOT think of the layer as
                "not yet accessible".  Instead, the function returns
                immediately with the object in its reset state (no members),
                since the frame does not really exist.  The way the JPX
                composition box works is that it is allowed to define frames
                which use non-existent layers, but once a reader encounters
                any such frame, it is supposed to ignore that frame and all
                subsequent frames.
           [>>] Apart from the condition mentioned above, a "not yet
                accessible" layer is one for which `jpx_source::access_layer'
                returns an empty interface, when called with a false value
                for its `need_stream_headers' argument.  Thus, a layer is
                deemed to be accessible if all the relevant JPX/JP2 boxes
                have been encountered, even if the relevant codestream
                main headers are not yet available.
           [//]
           Any instruction whose compositing layer is not yet accessible is
           included in the member list, even if it is known not to contribute
           to the region of interest, except if either of the following
           conditions occur:
           [>>] The composited imagery from this instruction is known to
                be globally invisible (not just within the region of interest,
                but not contributing to any part of the compositing surface);
                or
           [>>] The compositing layer already appears in some other
                contributing member instruction.
           [//]
           The reason for the above policy is that compositing layers are
           not accessible only if the JPX data source is being served by a
           dynamic cache, typically in a JPIP client-server application.  In
           order to open an interactive viewer for the frame, all relevant
           compositing layers will need to be accessible, so a JPIP query will
           need to be formed which references the compositing layers which
           are not currently available.  The present object is designed
           to facilitate the construction of such a JPIP query.
           [//]
           The function stops examining instructions once the compositing
           surface is completely covered by opaque imagery.
         [RETURNS]
           False if any of the compositing layers which might contribute
           to the composited frame cannot yet be accessed via
           `jpx_source::access_layer', when invoked with a false value for
           its `need_stream_headers' argument.  In this case, calling the
           function again may result in a smaller number of members being
           added, since we might not yet be able to determine whether or not
           a layer is opaque or even whether it is hidden by another layer
           known to be opaque.
           [//]
           As noted above, we say that a compositing layer is not accessible
           only if insufficient information is currently available to open
           it or determine its existence.  If we can determine that any
           required compositing layer will never exist (e.g., by using
           `jpx_source::count_compositing_layers'), the present function will
           return true, but with the number of members set to 0.  In this
           case, a subsequent call to `jpx_composition::access_frame', with
           exactly the same frame and track index should return an empty
           interface.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This second form of the `construct' function is provided mainly
           for backward compatibility with applications that used
           `jpx_composition::get_next_frame' and related functions to obtain
           opaque frame references, as opposed to the new-style
           `jpx_composition::access_frame' which retrieves functional
           `jpx_frame' interface objects.
           [//]
           The main difference between this version of the function and
           the first form of `construct' is that an `iteration_idx' must be
           explicitly supplied, to identify which specific composited
           animation frame is of interest out of the multiple frames that
           might potentially be associated with the single `jx_frame'
           reference -- if it has a non-zero `repeat_count' (see
           `jpx_composition::get_frame_info').
           [//]
           The other difference between the two `construct' functions is that
           whether or not previous persistent frames are included in the
           constructed expansion depends here upon the provision of an
           explicit `follow_persistence' argument, whereas the first form
           of the `construct' function finds this information within the
           `jpx_frame' interface itself (see `jpx_composition::access_frame's
           `include_persistents' argument for more on this).

           was used to obtain the `jpx_composition' interface from which

           `jpx_composition' object at all, including one that you may
           have obtained via `jpx_container_source::access_presentation_track'.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This powerful function provides a method for determining the
           visibility of a codestream (usually for a particular region of
           interest defined on the codestream) in the overall composition
           associated with the supplied `frame'.  Codestreams are assigned
           to frames through their compositing layers, so the function
           returns the index of the compositing layer associated with any
           match (-1 if there is none).
           [//]
           In most applications it is helpful to limit codestream matches to
           those which are used by one or more known compositing layers.  One
           way to supply a set of candidate compositing layers is by using
           the `layer_indices' and `num_layers' arguments.  Another
           complementary approach is to provide a number list metanode via
           the `numlist' argument, in which case compositing layer indices
           that are candidates are those for which `numlist.test_numlist_layer'
           returns true.  This second method is more powerful, because
           the `numlist.test_numlist_layer' function takes account of the
           compositing layer replication that may occur if the `numlist'
           metanode is embedded in a JPX container.  Both methods can actually
           be used together, in which case candidate compositing layers must
           pass the `numlist.test_numlist_layer' test and also be found within
           the `layer_indices' array.
           [//]
           In cases where a compositing layer cannot yet be accessed (when
           the ultimate source of data is a dynamic cache with incomplete
           information), the function assumes that it might potentially use
           the indicated codestream -- this is important for interactive
           applications involving JPIP.  This can lead to a lot of false
           matches if compositing layer restrictions are known to the caller
           but not provided here.
           [//]
           One of the main applications for this function is determining
           whether a region-of-interest defined at the file-format level, for
           one or more codestreams, is visible in a frame, so that the next
           visible frame can be located and displayed when the region of
           interest is selected from a menu by an interactive user.
           [//]
           The first two arguments have exactly the same interpretation as
           their namesakes in the `construct' function.  Unlike that function,
           however, the present function does not actually manipulate the
           internal structure of any object -- in fact this is a static
           function.
           [//]
           Since a given codestream might appear multiple times in the
           construction of a frame, the function provides you with the option
           to walk through each matching layer in which the codestream (or an
           identified region of it) might be visible in the composition.  This
           is done via the optional `initial_matches_to_skip' argument.  The
           caller may use this argument to figure out the layer in which the
           codestream (or its region of interest) is most visible.  In most
           cases, however, the first match is likely to be the most visible
           one, since the function works backwards from the top-most
           compositing layers to the bottom-most, the latter being more likely
           to be covered.
           [//]
           The function is only able to provide a conservative
           estimate of visibility, based upon intersecting the original
           region of interest with any opaque covering layers.  In particular,
           whenever an opaque layer covers the layer which contains this
           codestream's region of interest, the function estimates the
           visible portion of the region to be the largest rectangular
           subset of the original region, such that none of its rows and
           columns are completely covered.  Where multiple layers cover
           the region in complicated ways, this function may estimate the
           region to be visible even though it has been completely hidden.
           However, this is very unlikely.
           [//]
           As discussed for the `construct' function, it may not be possible
           to determine whether or not a compositing layer (or region thereof)
           is covered by another opaque layer if the potentially covering
           layer is not yet accessible (i.e, if `jpx_source::access_layer'
           returns an empty interface, when called with a false value
           for its `need_stream_headers' argument).  In such cases, the
           function errs on the side of assuming that the compositing layer
           or region in question is visible.  In fact, if a layer is
           not accessible, we cannot even determine which codestreams it
           uses, so the function assumes that the codestream in question
           belongs to that layer unless the layer is excluded by failure to
           match any of the entries in a supplied `layer_indices' array or
           failure to pass the `numlist.test_numlist_layer' test.
           In all of these cases, if more data arrives in a dynamic cache, it
           is possible that a subsequent call to this function will return
           false when provided with the same arguments.
         [RETURNS]
           The index of the compositing layer in which the codestream
           (or an identified region of the codestream) may be visible.
           A value of -1 is returned if no visible match is found.
         [ARG: source]
           See `construct'.
         [ARG: frame]
           See `construct'.
         [ARG: codestream_idx]
           Index of the codestream, whose visibility is being tested.
         [ARG: numlist]
           Ignored if an empty interface.  Also ignored if
           `numlist.get_numlist_info' returns false or indicates that the
           number list is not associated with any compositing layers at all.
           Otherwise, this argument provides constraints on the compositing
           layers that can be returned by the function.  In particular, the
           function will not consider any compositing layer that does not pass
           the test associated with `numlist.test_numlist_layer' to be a
           visibility match, regardless of whether or not the layer uses the
           codestream identified by `codestream_idx'.
           [//]
           This is useful in reducing the workload associated with locating
           a region of interest that is known to be associated with specific
           compositing layers.  The information is particularly beneficial
           when working with a dynamic cache whose contents may not yet have
           grown to the point where compositing layers can be accessed.
           In particular, if an inaccessible compositing layer cannot be
           excluded on the basis of the `numlist' array, it must be considered
           to use the codestream in question, at least for the time being.
         [ARG: layer_indices]
           If non-NULL, this argument also provides constraints on the
           compositing layers that can be returned by the function.  In
           particular, the function will not consider any compositing layer
           whose index is not found in this array to be a visibility match,
           regardless of whether or not the layer uses the codestream
           identified by `codestream_idx'.
           [//]
           As with `numlist', if an inaccessible compositing layer cannot be
           excluded on the basis of the `numlist' array, it must be
           considered to use the codestream in question, at least for the
           time being.
         [ARG: num_layers]
           Number of entries in the `layer_indices' array.
         [ARG: composition_region]
           On entry, if this region is non-empty, it identifies a region on
           the composited frame, in which the visibility of the codestream
           (or its region) is of interest.  This may, for example, be a
           viewport being used by an interactive viewer.  If empty, the
           region is considered to be that of the entire composited frame.
           [//]
           On exit, the `composition_region' object is set to contain the
           region of the codestream (restricted to any supplied
           `codestream_roi') which is actually visible, as expressed in
           the coordinate system of the composited image.
           [//]
           Note, however, that if the ultimate source of data is a dynamic
           cache and the function has been unable to access the compositing
           layer whose index is returned here, its association with the
           codestream is only assumed, so that the region returned via this
           argument might not be particularly meaningful.
         [ARG: codestream_roi]
           If this region is non-empty, it identifies a region of
           interest whose visibility we are testing, expressed with respect
           to the high resolution reference grid of the codestream in question,
           except that the location of the region is expressed relative to
           the origin of the image on the codestream, which might not always
           be the same as the origin of the high resolution reference grid
           itself (this is the same convention used by ROI description boxes
           in the JPX file format -- no accident).  If the region is empty,
           the region of interest is considered to be the entire codestream.
         [ARG: ignore_use_in_alpha]
           If true, the function ignores codestreams which are used only for
           generating opacity data for a compositing layer.  This is usually
           a good idea, since the file format only allows regions of
           interest to be specified on a per-codestream basis.  If the
           codestream contains some components which are used only for
           alpha blending channels and those components are used in some
           compositing layers which do not employ the actual imagery, it
           is unlikely that we will be interested in the region of interest
           within such layers.
         [ARG: initial_matches_to_skip]
           If zero, the function returns the first compositing layer in
           which the codestream (or its `codestream_roi') is visible
           (or visible within the originally supplied `composition_region').
           If this argument is set to 1, the function returns the second
           compositing layer in which the visibility conditions are found
           to hold; and so forth.

           Used to return whether or not this member instruction is known to

           determined completely at the time when `construct' was called
           (can happen only if the JPX data source is fueled by a dynamic
           cache which did not have enough information to open the
           compositing layer), this value will be set to false.

           Used to return the location and size of the source image region,

           event that the source dimensions were not specified in the
           composition box and the composition layer is now accessible
           (guaranteed if the present function returns true), the source
           dimensions will automatically be set to represent the full
           compositing layer.  This saves the application the trouble of
           figuring out the missing information itself.
         [ARG: target_dims]
           Used to return the location and size of the imagery composited
           by this member instruction, expressed relative to the compositing
           surface.  The interpretation of this region is identical to that
           described with `jpx_composition::get_instruction', except that in
           the event that the target size was not specified in the composition
           box and the composition layer is now accessible (guaranteed if
           the `construct' function returns true), the target size will
           automatically be derived from the source size (incorporating any
           `orientation' settings), which itself may be derived from the size
           of the compositing layer, if no source cropping was required.  This
           saves the application the trouble of figuring out the missing
           information itself.

           Used to return information about any re-orientation that must
           be applied to the source compositing layer prior to scaling and/or
           translating it to the `target_dims' region.  The interpretation of

           layers that use this codestream.
           [//]
           When invoked with `last_layer_id' < 0 (typically the first call
           in an enumeration sequence), the function makes an effort to parse
           any compositing layer headers that are likely to be relevant and
           are still outstanding.  However, you should be aware that if the
           ultimate `jp2_family_src' data source is a dynamic cache, some
           compositing layer headers might not yet be available and so this
           function will not be able to identify them.
           [//]
           The compositing layer indices returned by the function may be
           passed to `jpx_source::access_layer'; however, that function may
           return an empty interface if the layer's codestreams are not yet
           all available -- this is why the function works with layer
           identifiers, as opposed to `jpx_layer_source' interfaces, since the
           latter cannot be presented to the application until all relevant
           codesteam headers have at least been discovered.
         [RETURNS]
           -1 if there are no known compositing layers that use this codestream
           or if the one identified by `last_layer_id' is the last one that
           uses this codestream.
         [ARG: last_layer_id]
           If this argument corresponds to the identifier of a compositing
           layer that is know to use this codestream, the function returns the
           identifier of the next compositing layer that uses the codestream,
           or -1 if there is none.  Generally, you use this function to
           enumerate all the layers that use the codestream.  In this case,
           each successive call sets `last_layer_id' equal to the
           value returned by the previous call, or -1 if there was none.
      */
    KDU_AUX_EXPORT bool stream_ready();
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Returns true if the underlying codestream is represented by a
           contiguous codestream box whose main header is available, or by
           a fragment table box whose fragment list is completely available.
           In the latter case, it is not generally possible to assess whether
           the main header is available.  The return value can
           be false only if the source is ultimately fueled by a dynamic
           cache (i.e., a `jp2_family_src' object whose
           `jp2_family_src::open' function was passed a `kdu_cache' data
           source), and then only if the present interface was acquired by
           supplying a `false' value for the `need_main_header' argument to
           `jpx_source::access_codestream'.  Fragment tables should not
           generally be served directly by interactive servers so the fact
           that we cannot detect main headers for fragment tables should be
           of no concern.  If the function returns false, you should not
           pass the box returned by `open_stream' into
           `kdu_codestream::create'.  Calling the function again, once more
           data has been added to the dynamic cache, may result in a return
           value which is true.

           represented by a fragment table and `stream_ready' returns true.

      */
    KDU_AUX_EXPORT jpx_input_box *
      open_stream(jpx_input_box *my_resource=NULL);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function returns NULL if and only if `stream_ready' returns
           false.  Otherwise, the function either directly opens the
           contiguous codestream box or else it indirectly opens a
           virtual codestream box via its fragment list (if the codestream
           is represented by a fragment table).  In either case, the
           returned object's `jpx_input_box::get_box_type' function will
           return type `jp2_codestream_4cc' and the object will behave
           as if the codestream data were contiguous.
           [//]
           If `my_resource' is NULL, the function uses an internal
           `jpx_input_box' resource.  Every `jpx_codestream_source' object
           has one of these, which must be closed before it can be opened
           again (otherwise, the present function will generate an error
           through `kdu_error').  By passing in your own `jpx_input_box'
           object, however, as the `my_resource' argument, you can
           open multiple instances of the same codestream.  Regardless of
           whether the `my_resource' argument is NULL or not, a NULL return
           value has the same significance.

           may be recovered using `jpx_target::access_data_references'.
           [//]
           The purpose of the fragment is to define the actual JPEG2000
           codestream described by this object in terms of a collection of
           references to byte ranges in (usually) external files/URL's.
           The concatenated list of fragments represents the complete
           codestream.  If you call this function, or add a fragment directly
           to the `jpx_fragment_list' object returned by
           `access_fragment_list', the codestream will be recorded using
           a fragment table box rather than a contiguous codestream box.
           For this reason, you must not invoke `open_stream' or
           `access_stream'.  Instead, before closing the containing

           media data (mdat) and buried the codestream inside it --
           a trick used commonly by Motion JPEG2000 files.

           (relative or absolute) to be passed to
           `jp2_data_references::add_file_url', depending on the `is_path'
           argument.
         [ARG: is_path]

           `kdu_codestream::create', but you may also write to the
           box directly (e.g., to copy a codestream from one file to
           another).
           [//]
           If this is a top-level codestream (created directly using
           `jpx_target::add_codestream') you may call this function only
           once.  If this object is found within a JPX container, you are
           expected to write a total of R contiguous codestreams or
           fragment tables to this object (and every other codestream
           interface obtained via the same container's
           `jpx_container_target::access_codestream' function).  The value
           of R here is either the `repetition_factor' argument passed
           to the `jpx_target::add_container' function, or else it is
           determined "on-the-fly" by the number of times that you invoke
           `open_stream' or `write_fragment_table'.
           [//]
           You must close the returned box before attempting to open any
           other codestream box -- i.e., before any other call to
           `open_stream' or `write_fragment_table', in this object (if R > 1)
           or any other `jpx_codestream_target' object.
           [//]
           Furthermore, you must be sure to call `jpx_target::write_headers'
           to generate all relevant header information, before writing
           the actual codestreams.  If your application violates any of these
           conditions, an error will be delivered through `kdu_error'.
           [//]
           In many cases, you may wish to create a `kdu_codestream' object
           before the codestream box can be opened -- i.e., before the
           JPX file header can be written.  In particular, it is often
           convenient to use an open `kdu_codestream' to initialize the
           `jp2_dimensions' object.  The `access_stream' function enables
           you to obtain the interface required to create a `kdu_codestream'
           object prior to the point at which the present function is called,
           but note that you MUST at least call `open_stream' before making
           any attempt to flush codestream data with `kdu_codestream::flush'.
           [//]
           In cases where a repetition factor R > 1 applies, calls to
           `access_stream' will provide access to the next of the R
           codestream instances as soon as the box has been closed
           (or `write_fragment_table' has been called) for the previous
           instance.

           imagery before actually writing the JPX file header.  Note,

           Identifier of the codestream enumerated via `which'.  Codestream

           of the codestream within the data source.  Returns -1 if the

           0 to ask about the first codestream used by this compositing layer;

           forth.
         [ARG: alignment]
           Used to return horizontal and vertical alignment offsets.
           Specifically, the upper left hand sample of the code-stream's
           image region is located `alignment.x'/`denominator.x' samples
           to the right and `alignment.y'/`denominator.y' samples below
           the origin of this compositing layer's reference grid.  The
           JPX standard (accounting for corrigenda) requires these
           alignment offsets to lie in the half open interval [0,1), which
           means that 0 <= `alignment.x' < `denominator.x' and
           0 <= `alignment.y' < `denominator.y'.
         [ARG: sampling]
           Used to return horizontal and vertical sampling factors for the
           codestream.  Specifically, adjacent columns on the codestream's
           high resolution reference grid are separated by
           `sampling.x'/`denominator.x' samples on this compositing layer's
           reference grid.  Similarly, adjacent rows on the codestream's
           high resolution reference grid are separated by
           `sampling.y'/`denominator.y' samples on the compositing layer
           reference grid.
         [ARG: denominator]
           Used to return the denominator for the `alignment' and `sampling'
           expressions.  The values of `denominator.x' and `denominator.y' are
           guaranteed to be strictly positive.  Each compositing layer is
           guaranteed to have a single unique denominator, so that this
           argument will be set to the same values no matter what value is
           supplied for `which'.  This is true even if the value of `which'
           does not correspond to a valid codestream.

           This should be one of the codestream ID's used to specify channel
           mapping rules via the `jp2_channels' interface functions.
           Codestream identifiers start from 0 and correspond exactly with
           the order in which the codestream will appear in the JPX file,
           which is also the order in which the `jpx_codestream_target'
           interfaces were created using `jpx_target::add_codestream'.
         [ARG: alignment]
           Supplies horizontal and vertical alignment offsets.
           Specifically, the upper left hand sample of the code-stream's
           image region is located `alignment.x'/`denominator.x' samples
           to the right and `alignment.y'/`denominator.y' samples below
           the origin of this compositing layer's reference grid.  The
           JPX standard (accounting for corrigenda) requires these
           alignment offsets to lie in the half open interval [0,1), which
           means you must ensure that 0 <= `alignment.x' < `denominator.x'
           and 0 <= `alignment.y' < `denominator.y'.
           [//]
           Note also that `alignment' values must also lie in the
           range 0 to 255.
         [ARG: sampling]
           Supplies horizontal and vertical sampling factors for the
           codestream.  Specifically, adjacent columns on the codestream's
           high resolution reference grid are separated by
           `sampling.x'/`denominator.x' samples on this compositing layer's
           reference grid.  Similarly, adjacent rows on the codestream's
           high resolution reference grid are separated by
           `sampling.y'/`denominator.y' samples on the compositing layer
           reference grid.
           [//]
           Note that `sampling' factors must lie in the range 1 to 255.
         [ARG: denominator]
           Supplies the denominator for the `alignment' and `sampling'
           expressions.  The values of `denominator.x' and `denominator.y'
           must be strictly positive.  Each compositing layer may have only
           one unique denominator, so calling this function multiple times
           with different denominator values will cause an error to be
           generated through `kdu_error'.  Note that `denominator' values
           must lie in the range 1 to 65535.

     [SYNOPSIS]
       This object provides information associated with Compositing Layer
       Extensions boxes (known here as JPX containers).  There were
       introduced with Amendment 3 to IS15444-2.  They allow collections of
       compositing layer headers and codestream headers to be assembled
       within a single box, which can improve the efficiency of JPIP
       streaming applications, where a file has a very large number of such
       image entities.  Additionally, JPX containers have the following two
       valuable features:
       [>>] They provide a compact way of describing compositing layers
            whose metadata follows a simple repeating pattern.  For example,
            a file might contain thousands of compositing layers that are
            all identical except that the codestreams that they use
            increment as the compositing layer indices increment.
       [>>] They provide a means for extending the animation services
            offered by the JPX composition box into multiple presentation
            tracks, each with its own set of compositing layers.

           presentation track 0 includes only the top-level JPX Composition

           You should be aware that the present function might return an
           empty interface even if `track_idx' is positive and `get_num_tracks'
           returns non-zero.  If this happens, the underlying machinery is not
           yet able to parse far enough into the container's contents to
           recover all compositing instructions, or else the same is true
           for the top-level Composition box.  Either or both of these
           conditions are possible only if the underlying `jp2_family_src'
           data source is fueled by a dynamic cache (i.e., a `kdu_cache'
           object).
           [//]
           Most applications will not need to invoke this
           function, since the top-level `jpx_composition' interface,
           recovered via `jpx_source::access_composition', provides a
           `jpx_composition::access_frame' function that can be used to
           walk into any frame in any presentation track, without
           needing to worry about which specific container the frame
           belongs to.

     [SYNOPSIS]
       This object is used to manage a JPX container during content creation.
       JPX containers are added using the `jpx_target::add_container'
       function.  They allow collections of compositing layer headers and
       codestream headers to be assembled within a single box, which can
       help improve the efficiency of JPIP streaming applications where
       the file has a very large number of such image entities.  Additionally,
       JPX containers have the following two valuable features:
       [>>] They provide a compact way of describing compositing layers
            whose metadata follows a simple repeating pattern.  For example,
            a file might contain thousands of compositing layers that are
            all identical except that the codestreams that they use
            increment as the compositing layer indices increment.
       [>>] They provide a means for extending the animation services
            offered by the JPX composition box into multiple presentation
            tracks, each with its own set of compositing layers.
       [//]
       Objects of this class are merely interfaces to an internal
       object, which cannot be directly created by an application.
       Use `jpx_target::add_container' to obtain a non-empty interface.

           Use this function to access each of the base compositing layers
           of the container so that you can configure their attributes.
           The `which' parameter must be in the range 0 to Lbase-1 where
           Lbase is the value passed to `jpx_target::add_container' as its

           The container actually represents a total of Lbase*R
           compositing layers, where the number of repetitions R is
           explained in connection with the `jpx_target::add_container'
           function.  However, only the initial (base) compositing layers
           are explicitly configured and ultimately written as compositing
           layer header boxes within the container.
           [//]
           Special care should be paid when specifying codestream indices
           that are associated with the compositing layer, whether via
           calls to `jpx_layer_target::set_codestream_registartion',
           `jp2_channels::set_colour_mappings',
           `jp2_channels::set_opacity_mapping' or
           `jp2_channels::set_premult_mapping'.  Let c be the index of a
           codestream, as passed to one of these functions during the
           configuration of the compositing layer returned by this function.
           The value of c must either lie in the range 0 to Ctop-1, where
           Ctop is the value returned by `get_num_top_codestreams',
           or else it must lie in the range Cstart to Cstart+Cbase-1, where
           Cstart and Cbase are the values returned by `get_base_codestreams'.
           [//]
           Each reference to a codestream index c in the range 0 to Ctop-1
           remains unaltered in each of the R instances of the compositing
           layer.  However, if c lies in the range Cstart to Cstart+Cbase-1,
           the r'th instance of the compositing layer actually uses
           the codestream with index c+Cbase*r, where r ranges from 0 to R-1.
           [//]
           What all this means is that the 1'st instance of a compositing
           layer employ either top-level codestreams or else the 1'st
           instance of one of the codestreams found within the same container,
           whereas the r'th instance of the compositing layer employs either
           the same top-level codestreams as its 1'st instance, or else it
           employs the r'th repetition of the codestream used by the 1'st
           instance of the compositing layer.

           `jpx_codestream_target::write_fragment_table') a total of R times.
           You must be careful to write these codestreams in the correct
           order.  Specifically, you need to write the first instance of each
           of the Cbase codestreams first, then you need to write the second
           instance for each of the Cbase codestreams, and so on.

           compositing layers.  The compositing layer indices passed to
           `jpx_composition::add_instruction' are to be interpreted relative
           to the track's track-specific compositing layers.  To map between
           these track-specific layer indices and absolute compositing layer
           indices, you can use the `jpx_composition::map_rel_layer_idx'
           function.
           [//]
           To understand this mapping, let Lstart be the absolute layer index
           of the first compositing layer defined by the container and let
           Lbase be the `num_base_layers' argument that was passed to
           `jpx_target::add_container'.  Moreover, let T0 be the cumulative
           sum of all `track_layers' values supplied when adding earlier
           presentation tracks to this container.  Then the track-relative
           layer index Lr corresponds to the absolute compositing layer
           index La, where
           [>>] La = Lstart + T0 + Lbase*(Lr/track_layers) + (Lr%track_layers)

           You should take note of the following restrictions:
           [>>] The `repeat_count' argument to `jpx_composition::add_frame'
                may not be negative (i.e., no indefinite repetition).
           [>>] The total number of frames (counting repetitions) defined
                by calls to `jpx_composition::add_frame' must be the same
                for all `jpx_composition' objects associated with presentation
                tracks in this container.

           Configures the object to represent an elliptical region of

           supplies the elliptical representation in a manner which is
           directly compatible with the underlying JPX ROI representation.
           As such, if valid parameters are supplied on entry, the first
           form of the `get_ellipse' function will recover these same
           parameters exactly.  There is a second form of the `init_ellipse'
           function which can be used to initialize an ellipse based on its
           true axis lengths and angular orientation.  However, that function's
           parameters will be subjected to quantization.
           [//]
           Ellipses must be centred at an integer-valued location (Cx,Cy) on
           the relevant codestream's high resolution grid (measured with
           respect to the upper left hand corer on the encoded image on that
           grid).  This centre location is given by the `centre' argument.
           Ellipses must also be contained within a bounding box whose
           included edges have integer coordinates.
           [//]
           In the simplest case, with `skew'=(0,0), the ellipse's axes
           are oriented vertically and horizontally -- we refer to such an
           ellipse as "cardinally oriented".  In this case, the ellipse is
           fully characterized by its half-width (Wo=`extent.x') and
           half-height (Ho=`extent.y').  The elliptical region is then
           considered to include all locations (x,y) such that:
           [>>] (x - Cx)^2 / Wo^2 + (y - Cy)^2 / Ho^2 <= 1,
           [//]
           More generally, arbitrarily oriented elliptical regions are
           permitted.  It is a fundamental fact of geometry that any
           oriented ellipse can be obtained either by vertically skewing or
           by horizontally skewing a cardinally oriented ellipse.  In fact,
           any affine or perspective transformation of an ellipse is also
           still an ellipse (this may initially seem counter-intuitive for
           the case of perspective transformations).  In view of this, the
           `skew' argument simultaneously identifies two equivalent ways
           of obtaining the same ellipse by vertical or horizontal skewing.
           In fact, `skew' identifies the locations at which the oriented
           ellipse intercepts its bounding box.  In particular, the intercept
           with the top edge of the bounding box occurs at `centre.x'+`skew.x'
           and the intercept with the left edge of the bounding box occurs
           at `centre.y'-`skew.y'.  To see how the skewing procedures work,
           we first define the following quantities:
           [>>] alpha = `skew.x' / Ho -- horizontal skewing parameter
           [>>] beta  = `skew.y' / Wo -- vertical skewing parameter
           [//]
           The above parameters are necessarily coupled, if the horizontal and
           skewing procedures are to yield the same ellipse.  Specifically,
           we must have
           [>>] skew.x = round(Wo * gamma) and skew.y = round(Ho * gamma) for
                some parameter gamma in the range -1 < gamma < 1.
           [>>] Thus, alpha ~ Wo/Ho * gamma and beta ~ Ho/Wo * gamma.
           [>>] This means that alpha*beta ~ gamma^2.
           [//]
           The function internally adjusts `skew', if necessary, so as to
           ensure that -Wo < `skew.x' < Wo, -Ho < `skew.y' < Ho, Wo is within
           0.5 of Wo*gamma and `skew.y' is within 0.5 of Ho*gamma for some
           suitable gamma.
           [//]
           The horizontal and vertical skewing operations start with smaller
           ellipses which are identified by an inner half-width Wi and an
           inner half-height Hi.  These are obtained from
           [>>] Wi = Wo*sqrt(1-alpha*beta) = Wo*sqrt(1-gamma^2) and
           [>>] Hi = Ho*sqrt(1-alpha*beta) = Ho*sqrt(1-gamma^2).
           [//]
           The horizontal skewing procedure starts with a cardinally aligned
           ellipse of half-width Wi and half-height Ho and skews points at
           location (x,y) to (x-alpha*(y-Yc),y).  The skewed ellipse includes
           all locations (x,y) such that:
           [>>] (x-Cx+alpha*(y-Yc))^2 / Wi^2 + (y-Cy)^2 / Ho^2 <= 1.
           [//]
           The vertical skewing procedure starts with a cardinally aligned
           ellipse of half-width Wo and half-height Hi and skews points at
           location (x,y) to (x,y-beta*(x-Xc)).  The skewed ellipse includes
           all locations (x,y) such that:
           [>>] (y-Cy+beta*(x-Xc))^2 / Hi^2 + (x-Cx)^2 / Wo^2 <= 1.
           [//]
           Considering the definitions given above for the ellipse, it should
           be apparent that the smallest rectangularly shaped collection of
           locations (x,y) which could potentially belong to the ellipse is
           given by  Cx-Wo <= x <= Cx+Wo and Cy-Ho <= y <= Cy+Ho.
           Accordingly, the function sets the `region' member so that
           `region.pos' equals (Cx-Wo,Cy-Ho) and `region.size' equals
           (2*Wo+1,2*Ho+1).

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function is similar to the first form of `init_ellipse',
           except that the geometry of the elliptical region is supplied
           in the form of real-valued axis lengths and an orientation
           (expressed as tan(theta)).  The defined ellipse has its centre at
           the supplied `centre' location (expressed on the relevant
           codestream's high resolution canvas, relative to the
           upper left hand corner of the image region on that codestream).
           The ellipse may be understood as being formed by clockwise
           rotation by theta of an initial cardinally aligned ellipse
           of half-height V=`axis_extents'[0] and half-width
           U=`axis_extents'[1].
           [//]
           This function converts the supplied parameters to an elliptical
           representation in "standard form" through a bounding box and
           skewing parameters (as supplied directly to the first form of
           the `init_ellipse' function).  This generally involves some
           rounding of the transformed parameters to integer coordinates.
         [ARG: axis_extents]
           Two element array, the first element of which describes the
           half-length of the elliptical axis which is closest to vertical,
           while the second element describes the half-length of the
           elliptical axis which is closest to horizontal.  Equivalently,
           writing V=`axis_extents'[0] and U=`axis_extents'[1], U and V are
           the half-width and half-height of the initial cardinally aligned
           ellipse, prior to rotation clockwise through the angle whose
           tangent is `tan_theta'.  This initial ellipse contains all
           real-valued locations (x,y), such that:
           [>>] (x-Cx)^2/U^2 + (y-Cy)^2/V^2 <= 1, where (Cx,Cy) is the
                `centre' location.
         [ARG: tan_theta]
           Orientation of the axis of the ellipse whose half-length is
           given by `axis_extents'[0], expressed as tan(theta), where theta
           lies in the range -pi/4 to +pi/4 measures clock-wise rotation of
           a cardinally aligned ellipse.  Equivalently, `tan_theta' must
           lie in the range -1.0 to 1.0.  If not, it is clipped to this range.

           V, which has been rotated clockwise through an angle whose tangent

           Similar considerations apply to all shapes.
           [//]
           For elliptical regions, `width' is 1 more than twice the smaller of

           For simple rectangular regions, as returned by `get_rectangle',
           the function returns the smaller of `region.size.x' and
           `region.size.y' via `width' and the larger of these two dimensions
           via `length'. In this case, the return value is equal to 0 if the

           onto the boundary of the region, identifying the edge on which
           the projection is found and returning the projected point's
           coordinates via `xp' and `yp'.  The function also compares the
           Euclidean distance between (`x0',`y0') and the nearest point
           on the region with the supplied value of `max_distance'.  If
           this distance is exceeded, the function returns -1 and the
           `xp', `yp' values are undefined.  This is useful on a number of
           levels, but especially helps to improve efficiency, since it
           the iterative elliptical projection algorithm to be terminated
           early if we are sure that the distance will turn out to exceed
           `max_distance'.
           [//]
           For elliptical regions, the problem solved here is not trivial
           and the algorithm could potentially be more efficient.  For
           quadrilateral regions, the function projects onto each edge in
           turn, determining the location which is closest to (`x0',`y0').
         [RETURNS]
           The function return -1 if the `max_distance' threshold is
           exceeded.  Otherwise, it returns a value in the range 0 to 3,
           identifying the edge on which (`xp',`yp') is located.
           [//]
           For quadrilateral regions, the returned edge index has the same
           interpretation as it does in the `check_edge_intersection'
           function.  Specifically, edge p runs from vertex p to
           vertex (p+1) mod 4.
           [//]
           For simple rectangular regions, the function does the same thing
           as for general quadrilaterals, treating the top-left corner as
           vertex 0, the top right hand corner as vertex 1 and so forth in
           the usual clockwise order.
           [//]
           For elliptical regions, there is only one (curved) edge, whose
           index is 0.
         [ARG: tolerance]
           Tolerance of the iterative projection algorithm used for elliptical
           regions.  The tolerance can be precisely interpreted as follows.
           The returned (`xp',`yp') location is the closest point (in
           the Euclidean sense) to (`x0',`y0') on a potentially scaled version
           of the true elliptical boundary, where the scaling factor is so
           close to 1 that (`xp',`yp') is guaranteed to be within a distance
           of `tolerance' (horizontally and vertically) of a point on the
           boundary of the true ellipse.  For very small values of `tolerance'
           this is essentially the same as a tolerance on the Euclidean
           distance between (`xp',`yp') and the true projection onto the
           elliptical boundary.
           [//]
           This argument has no effect for non-elliptical regions.

           For simple rectangular regions (i.e., when `is_elliptical' is false
           and the `JPX_QUADRILATERAL_ROI' flag is not present in `flags'),
           this member holds the actual region of interest.  Otherwise, it
           hold the tightest bounding box for the quadrilateral which is
           described by the `vertices' array.  Note that `region.size'
           identifies the number of rows and columns of samples which are in
           the bounding box, so column `region.pos.x' lies inside the
           region's bounding box, whereas `region.pos.x'+`region.size.x' lies
           just outside -- same for rows `region.pos.y' and `region.pos.y'+
           `region.size.y'.
           [//]
           For elliptical regions, this member again identifies the tightest
           integer-aligned bounding box for the ellipse, which necessarily
           has odd dimensions, since the centre of the ellipse must have
           integer coordinates. The half-width Wo and half-height Ho of the
           ellipse are important geometric properties, defined to be
           Wo = (`region.size.x'-1)/2 and Ho = (`region.size.y'-1)/2.  See
           `init_ellipse' for more on how these quantities are interpreted.

           of the coordinates by 2 and round downwards.  The ellipse is
           defined by the half-width Wo=`region.size.x'>>1 and half-height
           Ho=`region.size.y'>>1, together with the `elliptical_skew' value.
           For cardinally aligned ellipses, `elliptical_skew' is (0,0) and
           the ellipse is defined by the set of points (x,y) such that
           (x-Cx)^2/Wo^2 + (y-Cy)^2/Ho^2 <= 1, where (Cx,Cy) is the
           centre location.

           top-most edge of this bounding box, while Cy-`elliptical_skew.y'

           If true, the behaviour of the function is modified if there is
           currently a selected anchor node, so as to implement the behaviour
           one would expect during a "snap while dragging" application.  In
           this case, the function ignores the selected anchor point during
           its search for the nearest anchor.  Moreover, the function
           considers the centres of ellipses to be valid anchor points that
           can be returned by this function, even if the object is not
           currently in skeleton mode.  This makes it easier for an
           interactive user to snap a vertex the the centre of an ellipse,
           for example.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function adds a new elliptical region and/or a new
           quadrilateral or elliptical region to the editor, depending on
           the `ellipses' argument and the current editing mode.
           [>>] In `JPX_EDITOR_VERTEX_MODE' or `JPX_EDITOR_SKELETON_MODE',
                at most one region is added (an ellipse if `ellipses' is
                true, or else a quadrilateral).
           [>>] In `JPX_EDITOR_PATH_MODE', if `ellipses' is true, the function
                adds both a circle and a quadrilateral extension from the
                currently selected edge.  The circle helps to round the
                junctions created while editing paths.
           [//]
           The exact geometry of the added region or regions depends on the
           active edge associated with the currently selected region, as well
           as the editing mode.  The active edge is the one associated
           with the `JPX_EDITOR_STATE_SELECTED' flag in calls to `get_edge'
           and/or calls to `get_ellipse'.  The active edge advances each time
           `select_anchor' is called with the same anchor point and with
           the `advance' argument equal to true.  If there is no current
           selection, this function does nothing, returning an empty region.
           [//]
           The location and shape of the new region depends upon the
           active edge in a manner which is open to change in the future,
           but should be intuitive once the anchor point and edge
           information provided by `get_anchor' and `get_edge' are
           displayed to an interactive user.  In the event that there is
           no active edge associated with a selection, all edges associated
           with the selected anchor point must have zero length -- i.e.,
           both end-points identical.  If this happens, the location and
           size of the new region are based upon the selected anchor point
           itself.
           [//]
           The `visible_frame' argument provides a region, expressed with
           respect to the same coordinate system as the ROI region coordinates,
           which is visible within the graphical editor which is driving
           this object.  As a general rule, it is helpful to an interactive
           user if newly added regions fit within this frame and this is what
           the function endeavours to do.
           [//]
           It is possible that the function will refuse to add new regions
           because the number of region elements which a JPX ROI description
           box can hold is limited to 255.  If the number of elements consumed
           by the existing regions is larger than 253, the function will not
           add a new region, because the new region may require as many as
           2 elements to represent, unless it is a simple rectangle or
           a simple ellipse.
           [//]
           You cannot determine whether the above-mentioned limit is exceeded
           simply by monitoring the function's return value, as explained
           below.  However, you can explicitly call `measure_complexity'
           first; if the return value is greater than 0.99, the present
           function will not add a new region.
         [RETURNS]
           A region large enough to include all points and edges affected
           by the change.  Even if there is no change, this region might not
           be empty because the function invokes `cancel_drag'.
         [ARG: visible_frame]
           If this region is empty, no restrictions are imposed on the way
           in which a new region is added.  Otherwise, the function tries
           to add new regions in such a way that they fit (at least partially)
           within the `visible_frame' so that the effect of the operation is
           obvious to an interactive user.

           complexity is based on the number of individual region elements
           which would be required to represent the current configuration in
           a JPX ROI description box.  This value may not exceed 255.  Some
           quadrilateral/elliptical regions require two elements, while others
           require only 1.  Since the internal storage is sufficient to
           hold up to 255 quadrilaterals/elliptical regions, it is possible
           for the complexity to be as large as 2.0, yet configurations
           with complexity greater than 1.0 are not externally representable.
           [//]
           When the complexity becomes too high, `move_selected_anchor' may
           fail with a warning and `add_region' will not add anything.
           The `move_selected_anchor' function explicitly prevents any
           change which would cause the complexity to exceed 1.0, while
           `add_region' takes the conservative position that there must
           enough spare capacity to add an arbitrary ellipse or quadrilateral
           without exceeding a complexity of 1.0.  However, other functions
           like `split_selected_anchor' are not checked, since there is no
           risk of violating internal storage constraints.  This is OK,
           because such operations may be precursors to editing operations
           which may restore the limit.  In any case, an application can
           always explicitly call this function after performing any editing
           operation and then execute `undo' if the operation is not suitable.
         [RETURNS]
           A value in the range 0.0 to 2.0, where 1.0 is the maximum complexity

      add_scribble_point(kdu_coords point);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Provides a service for accumulating points which define a
           "scribble path".  Successive points along the path are assumed
           to be connected in some way (not necessarily by straight line
           segments).  Typically, these points correspond to successively
           detected mouse locations while an interactive user moves
           the mouse with a button held down.  However, they could be
           generated from any number of other application-dependent
           processes.  One reason for accumulating scribble paths in
           this object is that the `undo' and `redo' functions will then
           automatically manage the scribble paths as well, which facilitates
           the implementation of an interactive editor.
           [//]
           One noteworthy feature of the current function is that it
           automatically eliminates loops in the evolving scribble path.
           Thus, as points are added, the total number of points in the
           path (as returned by `get_scribble_path') may actually decrease.
           The function detects a loop whenever the line segment joining the
           newly added point and the previous one intersects or touches the
           line segment joining any existing pair of consecutive scribble
           points.  Upon detection, the function removes either the loop or
           the leading section of the scribble path, whichever is shorter,
           in such a way as to ensure that no scribble point so much as
           touches any other scribble point or any line segment between
           adjacent scribble points.
           [//]
           Also, if some internal limit on the maximum number of scribble
           points is exceeded, the function reduces the path complexity by
           sub-sampling points that have already been collected.  This
           process may also cause the number of points identified by
           `get_scribble_points' to decrease discontinuously as points
           are progressively added.
         [RETURNS]
           A region large enough to include all points and edges affected
           by the change.  This might be larger than you think if some
           sub-sampling occurred, or loops were removed.
         [ARG: point]
           Points have the same interpretation as all other locations managed
           by the editor; i.e., each point corresponds to a location on
           the high resolution canvas coordinate system of some codestream,
           measured with respect to the origin of the image in that codestream.

           A region large enough to include all points and edges affected
           by the change.  This region is guaranteed to be empty if and
           only if the scribble path could not be converted with
           the requested `accuracy'.  This is more likely, of course, if
           `replace_content' is false, since then the resources available
           for representing the approximation are further constrained by
           the existing regions which the editor is managing.
         [ARG: replace_content]
           If true, the function removes all regions which it is managing
           before adding quadrilaterals/ellipses to approximate the scribble
           path.  If the function returns false, however, nothing is erased.
           In any case, you can always get any deleted regions back again
           via the `undo' operation.
         [ARG: conversion_flags]
           Any combination of the `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_FILL' and
           `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_ELLIPSES' flags may be used here, with the
           following implications:
           [>>] `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_FILL' and `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_ELLIPSES' --
                In this case, the function generates a collection of
                ellipses and/or quadrilaterals, which form a single connected
                region, whose boundary approximates the scribble path to
                within a tolerance which is ultimately determined by the
                `accuracy' value.  Initial implementations of this mode may
                not actually introduce ellipses, but the idea is eventually
                to use ellipses to approximate convex portions of the boundary
                wherever this is efficient.
           [>>] `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_FILL' only -- in this case, the function
                uses quadrilaterals only to create a single connected region
                (a polygon) whose boundary approximates the scribble path,
                to within a tolerance determined by the `accuracy' values.
           [>>] `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_ELLIPSES' only -- in this case, the function
                approximates the scribble path itself with a collection of
                connected line segments (quadrilaterals which have only two
                distinct vertices) and inserts circles of radius 1 at the
                end-points of every line segment.  If the `set_path_thickness'
                function is subsequently used to widen the resulting path,
                these circles will serve to provide rounded corners.
           [>>] 0 -- in this case, the function behaves as above, except that
                no junctions are inserted.  If the path is subsequently
                widened with `set_path_thickness', it will have a strictly
                polygonal boundary.
         [ARG: accuracy]
           This argument takes a value in the range 0.0 to 1.0, whose
           interpretation is left up to the internal implementation.  As
           expected, larger values should more closely approximate
           the path defined by the scribble points, but the scale is
           non-linear.  The accuracy is also relative to the size of the
           region defined by the scribble path.  As a general rule, a
           value of 0.5 is intended to provide a moderate level of
           approximation, which is usable but usually far from perfect.  A
           value of 1.0 will cause the function to approximate the scribble
           path to within an error of at most 1 grid point.  No higher
           accuracy values make any sense.

      set_path_thickness(int thickness, bool &success);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This powerful function modifies all "path brick" regions, as
           defined under `enum_paths', so as to ensure that the
           "thickness" of the regions which define path segments is as
           close as possible to the supplied value.  Only true path bricks
           are modified, as opposed to "potential path bricks".
           The function also modifies any elliptical region whose centre lies
           at the end-point of a path segment, setting such ellipses to
           circles whose diameter is as close as possible to `thickness'.
           [//]
           The function is careful not to alter the path segments themselves
           in any way.  The thickness of a path brick is defined to be
           the distance between the two edges which run on either side of
           the brick's path segment.  The path segment itself runs between
           the mid-points of the other two edges.
           [//]
           The compatible edges associated with path bricks are modified in
           pleasing ways, according to the following policy:
           [>>] If the end of a path segment lies at an edge which is not
                a compatible edge, or which is shared with an ellipse (as
                defined above), that edge is aligned perpendicularly to the
                path segment.
           [>>] If the end of a path segment lies at a compatible edge of
                non-zero extent (i.e., the end-points of the edge are not
                the same point), which is not shared with any ellipse, the
                edge is modified simultaneously in both quadrilaterals, so as
                to preserve the sharing property.  If both quadrilaterals are
                path bricks, this is done in such a way that the thicknesses
                of both path bricks is established.
           [//]
           Note that the `thickness' value is interpreted with respect to the
           notion that each individual sample point has a size of 1x1.
           Thus, a `thickness' of 1 means that each path brick has only two
           distinct vertices, so that the path brick region is actually a
           line which coincides with the path segment itself.  As a general
           rule, it is better to request odd valued `thickness' values, since
           path bricks which run horizontally or vertically can achieve
           such thicknesses precisely.
           [//]
           It is worth noting that isolated path bricks (i.e., quadrilateral
           regions which do not share any edges with other quadrilaterals)
           must not be as thick as their path segment is long -- otherwise,
           the path segment would switch to run between the opposite two
           edges (see the explanation under `enum_paths').  The
           function imposes this restriction automatically.
         [RETURNS]

           by the change.

           successfully modify all path bricks and path junctions.  If

  KDU_AUX_EXPORT kdu_dims
    fill_closed_paths(bool &success, int required_member_idx=-1);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This powerful function is essentially used to convert
           paths into filled polygon regions.  The principle intent is
           to allow an interactive user to map out the boundary of a
           polygon region by drawing a path around it -- usually done in
           the `JPX_EDITOR_PATH_MODE' editing mode -- and then convert the
           path into a filled polygon.  As described under `enum_paths', a
           "path" is defined by a collection of connected "path segments",
           where each path segment arises from a quadrilateral region with
           simple connectivity.
           [//]
           This function uses `enum_paths' internally to enumerate all the
           paths associated with the current configuration.  It considers
           only closed paths (those whose `path_start' and `path_end'
           coordinates are identical, as returned via `enum_paths').  If
           `required_member_idx' is -ve, the function fills all closed
           paths.  Otherwise, it fills only the closed path (if any) which
           includes `required_member_idx' amongst its members (as returned
           via the `path_members' array passed to `enum_paths').
           [//]
           For each filled path, the function effectively deletes all the
           path bricks for that path (these are the quadrilateral regions
           whose indices are returned via the `path_members' array passed
           to `enum_paths') and replaces them with new quadrilateral
           regions which fully partition the region contained within the
           external edges of the original path bricks.  Several things are
           worth noting here:
           [>>] The filled region fully covers all the original path bricks
                which comprised the path, rather than stopping at the
                path segments themselves, which run down the middle of their
                path bricks.
           [>>] The filled region is partitioned into quadrilaterals,
                meaning that the filling quadrilaterals do not overlap.
           [>>] The filling quadrilaterals meet one another at their vertices.
                No vertex of one filling quadrilateral lies meets an edge
                of another filling quadrilateral at an intermediate position.
           [>>] Connected path bricks either share a common edge or else
                the edge mid-points which define their respective path
                segments are identical.  This second condition means that
                the path bricks which define the boundary of the filled
                region are not necessarily joined at their vertices.
                Nevertheless, the filling quadrilaterals which span these
                path bricks and the entire interior of the closed path do
                join at their vertices.
         [RETURNS]
           A region large enough to include all points and edges affected
           by the change.  This region will be empty if the function does
           nothing at all, because there are no appropriate paths to fill.
         [ARG: success]
           Used to return an indication of whether or not the function
           ran to completion.  The value may be set to false, even if the
           function has a non-empty return region, if the number of regions
           required to complete the filling procedure exceeds the internal
           storage capacity, in which case the maximum complexity would
           definitely be exceeded by the requested operation.  It may be
           a good ideal to call `measure_complexity' anyway after this
           function returns, if you want to be sure that the filled polygons
           can be completely saved in a JPX ROI description box, since
           internal storage is usually sufficient to exceed the maximum
           allowable complexity of a JPX ROI description box.
         [ARG: required_member_idx]
           If non-negative, the function only processes closed paths
           which include, as one of their members, the region with index
           `required_member_idx' -- there can be at most one of these, since
           separate invocations of `enum_paths' return disjoint collections
           of path members.  This index may, for example, be the index of
           a currently selected region, as returned by `get_selection'.

           Use this function to walk through all the "paths" which are
           associated with the current configuration, discovering the
           participating regions as you go.  To use this function,
           you must first understand how paths are defined.  Before we do
           this, however, we point out that the function retrieves an entire
           collection of connected regions in one go, returning their
           inidices via the 255-element `path_members' array and setting a
           single bit flag in the 8-element `path_flags' array for each
           region which is found to belong to the path.  When calling this
           function for the first time, all 8 members of the `path_flags'
           array must be equal to 0.  To enumerate subsequent paths, the
           function may be called again, passing in the same `path_flags'
           values (without re-initializing it).  The function uses this
           information to discover the first path which has not yet been
           enumerated, if any.
           [//]
           A "path" is formed by quadrilateral regions with simple
           connectivity, as explained below.  Paths can be understood as the
           skeletal representation of this connectivity, around which the
           region boundaries can be expanded or contracted using the powerful
           `set_path_thickness' function.  Path junctions can be formed
           using ellipses or by simple sharing of edges between quadrilateral
           regions.  Paths provide a natural formalism for many interactive
           shape editing operations, but they also provide a means for
           calculating geometric properties of regions of interest.
           [//]
           We begin by pointing out that a path is composed of a collection
           of connected path segments, each of which is the line segment
           which joins the mid-points of opposing edges of some quadrilateral.
           The quadrilateral in question is called a "path brick" and all
           path bricks are members of the path.  Ellipses do not themselves
           contribute path segments, but their presence may contribute to
           the determination of which quadrilateral edges are used to
           define path segments.  Moreover, ellipses which are centered at
           the end-points of any path segment are considered to be members
           of the path.
           [//]
           Intuitively, a path brick is a long, thin region, which contributes
           a single "path segment" that runs down the middle between the
           mid-points of its opposite edges.  Formally, we define a path brick
           and its associated path segment as follows:
           [>>] A quadrilateral is said to have a "compatible edge" if: (a) the
                edge has identical end-points to an edge in exactly one other
                quadrilateral; or (b) the mid-point of the edge is the centre
                of some ellipse (the geometry of the ellipse is irrelevant);
                or (c) the end-points of the edge are identical (i.e., the
                edge is a single point).  Any or all of these three conditions
                may hold.  Thus, for example, a compatible edge might be
                shared by two or more other quadrilaterals so long as its
                mid-point coincides with the centre of an ellipse.
           [>>] A "triangle" is a quadrilateral region which has only three
                distinct vertices.
           [>>] A "singularity" is a quadrilateral region, in which all
                vertices coincide.
           [>>] A quadrilateral is said to have a "multiply shared edge" if
                that edge has identical end-points to an edge in two or more
                other quadrilaterals and it does not satisfy the conditions
                for being a "compatible edge".
           [>>] A quadrilateral region is a "potential path brick" if it is
                not a triangle, not a singularity, has no multiply
                shared edges and it has one of the following:
                (a) no compatible edges; (b) 1 compatible edge; or (c)
                2 opposing compatible edges (i.e., compatible edges with no
                common vertex).  In case (b), the region's path segment runs
                between the mid-point of the compatible edge and the
                mid-point of the opposing edge.  In case (c), the region's
                path segment runs between the mid-points of the two compatible
                edges.  In case (a), the region's path segment runs between
                the two opposing edges which are furthest apart.
           [>>] A quadrilateral region which is a potential path brick is
                said to be an actual "path brick" only if its path segment
                has non-zero length and is fully contained within the
                quadrilateral region.  Only true path bricks actually
                contribute path segments.
           [//]
           In the event that a path contains junctions -- i.e., where a
           path segment shares its end-point with more than one other
           path segment -- the function considers each branch from the
           junction to be a separate path.  The function essentially
           finds a novel path brick and then builds out from it until
           it comes back to itself (a loop) or encounters a junction.  One
           implication of this is that the function can only return a complete
           closed path if it has no junctions.  This is deliberate, because
           junctions make it possible otherwise to interpret closed paths
           in many different ways.  If you wish to discover closed paths
           with junctions you can assemble the results produced by multiple
           invocations of this function and analyze their `path_start'
           and `path_end' coordinates.
         [RETURNS]
           Returns the number of regions which participate in the path.  If
           this is 0, there are no more paths.  Otherwise, the return value
           corresponds to the number of entries of `path_members' which have
           been set by this function.
         [ARG: path_flags]
           An array with at least 8 elements, whose entries together provide
           256 bit flags, which correspond to individual regions that may
           belong to current or previous paths.  On entry, if a flag is set,
           the corresponding region is a member of a previously enumerated
           path.  On exit, flags corresponding to members of the current path
           are also set.
         [ARG: path_members]
           An array containing at least 255 entries (to be sure there will be
           no overwriting).  The function writes the indices of each region
           which participates in the path into this array, where the number
           of such regions is the function's return value.  Note that the
           path members are written to this array in sequence, so that
           consecutive members are connected via path segments.  Path members
           include both path bricks and ellipses whose centres lie on one
           of the end-points of a path segment.  Where ellipses are included
           in the returned path members, they are considered as zero length
           path segments whose end-points lie at the centre of the ellipse,
           for the purpose of establishing a return sequence.
           [//]
           Region indices have the same interpretation as in the

           Similar to `get_anchor', this function is used to walk through all
           the straight edges of individual regions within the current edit

           walk through the boundaries of elliptical regions.
           [//]
           Each individual region can represent at most an arbitrary
           quadrilateral, so there will be at most 4 edges per region.
           In multi-region ROI's, regions will typically share common edges,
           so this function may return multiple copies of the same edge.

                belongs to a region which is marked as "encoded", meaning that
                ROI encoding procedures have been used within that region in
                the relevant codestream.
           [>>] The `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_SELECTED' flag means that the edge
                has been selected -- a graphical user interface should somehow
                highlighted a selected edge in a manner which identifies
                which region the selected edge belongs to (since regions
                may frequently have common edges).  To do this, you should
                note that the vector from `from' to `to' corresponds to
                a clockwise traversal of the relevant region's boundary.
           [>>] The `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_SHARED' flag means that the edge is
                shared with at least one edge of another quadrilateral --
                that is, both end-points of the edge are identical to
                end-points of an edge in another quadrilateral.  The function
                never includes this flag unless the `want_shared_flag' argument
                is true, since it takes some extra effort to determine
                the shared status of edges.
         [ARG: selected_region_only]
           If true, the function enumerates edges only from the currently

           ignoring the effect of any drag operation.
         [ARG: want_shared_flag]
           If true, the function determines the shared status of each edge
           so that the `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_SHARED' flag can be set correctly.
           Otherwise, the return value never includes `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_SHARED'.

  /* Notes:
       The `init' function sets up the `vertices' member of each elliptical
     or rectangular `jpx_roi' structure to hold the extreme points of the
     region.  For rectangular regions, these are the vertices, running in
     clockwise order from top-left.  For elliptical regions, these are the
     end-points of the major and minor axes, adjusted slightly (if required)
     to coincide with vertices of non-elliptical regions.  Whenever extreme
     points may need to be regenerated, the `update_extremities' function is
     invoked.
       The extreme points of adjacent regions are considered to be connected
     (and hence move together) if they have the same locations.
       The `drag_flags' array is configured whenever a new anchor point is
     selected.  It contains one byte for each region, identifying which of
     its extreme points are required to move when the selected anchor point is
     dragged/moved.  All of these extreme points must move together in the
     current implementation.  Only the least significant 4 bits of each byte
     are actually used to identify the extremities which must move.
       The interpretation of `edge_idx' is as follows.  Elliptical regions
     are considered to have 3 edges: an `edge_idx' of 0 means the ellipse
     itself, while values of 1 and 2 correspond to the horizontal and
     vertical axes respectively.  For quadrilateral regions, the `edge_idx'
     has the same interpretation as that identified for `jpx_roi'.
     Specifically an `edge_idx' of E refers to the edge running from
     vertex E to vertex (E+1) mod 4.
       The `path_edge_flags' array is used to identify and work with paths.
     If `path_edge_flags_valid' is false, the `find_path_edge_flags' function
     is called, to update this array.  Each entry in the array identifies
     information for the corresponding region.  The least significant 4 bits
     of each entry identify the edges which are shared with exactly one
     other quadrilateral and not with any ellipse, starting from the edge
     with index 0 in the LSB.  The indexing of edges follows the same policy
     as `jpx_roi::check_edge_intersection'.  The two MSB's have the following
     interpretation: 0 means not a path brick; 1 means a path brick whose
     path segment runs between edges 0 and 2; 2 means a path brick whose
     path segment runs between edges 1 and 3; 3 means an ellipse whose
     centre coincides with the end-point of a path segment.
       The `shared_edge_flags' array maintains information about which edges
     are shared with others.  A shared edge is one for which both end-points
     are in common with another edge.  The `shared_edge_flags_valid' member
     keeps track of whether this information needs to be regenerated from
     scratch or not.  The information is used to help the `get_edge'
     function correctly report the shared/unshared status of edges which
     it returns, without having to conduct a full search.  Only the 4 LSB's
     of each byte are used and they are associated with edges in the same
     way as the four LSB's of each byte in the `path_edge_flags' array.

       function, plus any association (`asoc') boxes and the first sub-box
       of any association box.  Boxes which are not represented by this
       object are those which are directly related to rendering the
       compressed imagery.  Typical examples of boxes managed by the object
       are XML boxes, number list boxes, label boxes, ROI description boxes,
       UUID boxes, IP-rights boxes and Cross-Reference boxes.
       [//]
       Each intermediate node in the tree (i.e. everything other than the root
       and the leaves) corresponds to an association relationship, which could
       be represented using a JPX association (`asoc') box.  In some cases,
       the relationship might be represented by some other means, such
       as inclusion of the relevant metadata within a codestream header or
       compositing layer header box, but it is easiest to understand the
       tree structure by assuming that each intermediate node corresponds
       to exactly one association box.  The first sub-box of an association
       box plays a special role, describing an entity to which all subsequent
       sub-boxes are to be associated.  These subsequent sub-boxes are
       represented by the node's descendants (branches in the tree), while
       the contents of the first box are considered to belong to the node
       itself.
       [//]
       In cases where the first sub-box of an association is itself an
       association box, it is unclear exactly what association was
       intended.  For this reason, we do not include the first sub-box of
       an association amongst the descendants of a node.  All other sub-boxes
       are treated as descendants (branches) whose nodes may be further
       split if they contain association boxes.
       [//]
       There are two important cases for the first sub-box of an association
       box, as follows:
         [>>] If the first sub-box of an association is a number list (`nlst')
              box, all descendants of the node are associated with the image
              entities listed in the number list box.  These entities may be
              codestreams, compositing layers, or the entire composited image.
         [>>] If the first sub-box of an association is an ROI description
              (`roid') box, all descendants of the node are associated with
              the rectangular and/or elliptical regions described by that
              box.
       [//]
       The above two special cases are represented explicitly and the
       association parameters may be explicitly created and retrieved
       via the various member functions offered by the `jpx_metanode'
       interface.
       [//]
       As mentioned previously, the associations embodied by an
       intermediate node in the metadata tree might not necessarily arise
       from the appearance of an `asoc' box within the JPX file.  In
       particular, wherever any of the metadata boxes mentioned above appears
       within a codestream header or a compositing layer header box, the
       metadata will be treated as though it had been contained within an
       `asoc' box whose first sub-box was a number list box which referenced
       the relevant codestream or compositing layer.  When the information
       in a `jpx_metanode' tree is used to write a new JPX file, however,
       associations will generally be formed using `asoc' boxes, rather than
       by inclusion within codestream header or compositing layer header boxes.
       [//]
       Leaves in the tree have no descendants.  A leaf node represents a
       single JP2 box, which is not further divided through the use of
       `asoc' boxes.
       [//]
       In the above, we have described intermediate nodes and leaf nodes.
       The one additional type of node is the tree root, to which access
       is granted using `jpx_meta_manager::access_root'.  All descendants
       of the root node correspond to metadata which (at least notionally)
       resides at the top level of the file.  Whereas intermediate nodes
       have their own box, which corresponds to the first sub-box of an
       association box (whether real or implied), the root node has no
       box of its own; it has only descendants and its box-type is
       returned as 0.
       [//]
       The `jpx_metanode' interface is designed to meet the needs of file
       readers and file writers, including incremental file parsers, which
       may be accessing a JPX data source which is being supplied by a
       dynamic cache whose contents are written in some arbitrary order by
       a remote JPIP server.  Both reading and writing functions may be
       used together to interactively edit an existing metadata tree.  For
       this reason, provision is made to read boxes which are described by
       any of the methods allowed during writing, including boxes which
       are described by reference to an existing node (possibly in another
       metadata tree) and boxes which are described by placeholders which
       are used to defer box generation until the file is actually being
       written.
       [//]
       You should be aware that if the ultimate source of data is a dynamic
       cache, the metadata hierarchy may evolve over time, as more data
       becomes available (typically from a JPIP server).  The
       `jpx_meta_manager' and `jpx_metanode' interfaces provide various
       functions to help you deal with this.  At the top level, the
       `jpx_meta_manager::load_matches' function can be used to update the
       state of the entire metadata hierarchy, based on any new data that
       may have become available.  The `jpx_meta_manager::get_touched_nodes'
       function also provides you with a generic mechanism to identify any
       nodes in the hierarchy that have changed in any way, which includes
       changes introduced by `jpx_meta_manager::load_matches' when it parses
       newly available boxes.  At a local level, however, several of the
       functions defined by the `jpx_metanode' interface do parse relevant
       boxes on-demand so as to ensure that their results are as up-to-date
       as possible with respect to the possible arrival of new data in the
       ultimate data source.  These functions are:
       [>>] `count_descendants' -- parses just enough data to ensure that it
            can provide the most up-to-date count;
       [>>] `get_next_descendant' and `get_prev_descendant' -- these parse
            just enough data to ensure the most up-to-date return value.
       [>>] `get_link' -- parses just enough data to resolve an as-yet
            unresolved link target (only if the `try_to_resolve' argument is
            true) and also parses just enough data to read the type and
            contents of any resolved link target that has not yet been fully
            read.
       [>>] `add_copy' -- when invoked with `recurse'=true, this function
            parses enough data to ensure that the descendants of the node
            being copied are as up-to-date as possible, so that the copy is
            as current as possible.
       [//]
       For the added convenience of incremental readers, editors and other
       interesting applications which may interact with JP2/JPX metadata,
       the `jpx_meta_manager' object provides methods for retrieving metanodes
       based on the file address of their constituent boxes, for enumerating
       metanodes based on their association with image entities and/or
       regions of interest, and for efficiently scanning through metanodes
       which have been recently parsed from the data source or changed
       by editing operations.  Furthermore, the `jpx_metanode' interface
       provides methods for identifying whether a node has been changed
       by editing operations and for saving an application-defined pointer
       (usually a pointer into some data structure maintained by the
       application).  Together, these features can be used to efficiently
       track changes in the metadata structure due to editing or incremental
       reading of a data source (typically, as it becomes available from a
       dynamic cache).
       [//]
       Kakadu also provides extensive support for discovery, creating,
       copying and writing metadata links.  A metadata link is represented
       in the JPX file using a cross-reference box, which points to the
       contents of another box.  Cross-reference boxes may potentially
       be used for many things and in many ways, but Kakadu exploits
       them to represent links between nodes in the metadata tree, allowing
       for the construction of arbitrary graphs.  The most natural
       interpretation of a cross-reference box which points to another box
       is that the referenced box should be treated as though it appeared
       in place of the cross-reference box.  Keeping this in mind, if a
       cross-reference box points to an `asoc' box, Kakadu treats the
       cross-reference as a link to the entire sub-tree embedded within that
       asoc box -- such links are termed "Alternate Child" links and assigned
       a `jpx_metanode_link_type' of `JPX_ALTERNATE_CHILD_LINK'.
       Cross-references which point to leaves in the metadata tree (i.e., to
       non-asoc boxes which are not the first sub-box of an asoc box) are
       also interpreted as "Alternate Child" links.  Applications may
       choose to follow alternate child links to the `jpx_metanode' to which
       they point, interpreting that node and all its descendants as though
       they were additional descendants of the node in which the link (i.e.,
       the cross-reference) is found.
       [//]
       Kakadu also defines two other types of cross-reference linking
       relationships, known as "Grouping links" and "Alternate Parent"
       links, whose semantics are useful in constructing metadata graphs.
       Although the interpretation of internal cross-references is not
       made clear in the standard itself, Kakadu's interpretations and usage
       are natural and intuitive.  For more information on links and link
       types, see the `get_link' and `add_link' member functions, as well as
       the powerful graph parsing function, `find_path_to'.
       [//]
       Note carefully that objects of the `jpx_metanode' class are merely
       interfaces to an internal object, which cannot be directly created
       by an application.  Use the member functions offered by
       `jpx_meta_manager' to obtain a non-empty interface.
       [//]
       From version 7.0, Kakadu provides special support for hiding the
       presence of super-boxes which are used only to structure the file
       hierarchy (primarily for efficient deployment via JPIP).  These
       boxes have no semantics of their own.  The main one is the Grouping
       ('grp_') box, introduced with Ammendment 2 of IS15444-2 (JPEG2000
       Part 2).  Prior to the introduction of Grouping boxes, Kakadu
       sometimes used Association boxes, whose first sub-box was a `free'
       box, to serve the same role as a Grouping box.  The `jpx_metanode'
       object's `get_descendant', `get_next_descendant', `get_prev_descendant',
       `count_descendants' and other related functions can now
       behave as if these structuring boxes were removed, recursively
       elevating their non-structuring sub-boxes to the same level in the
       file hierarch so as to create a flat structure.  This feature can
       be customized by the `jpx_meta_manager::set_behaviour'
       function, along with the way in which structuring boxes are
       generated during file writing.

      get_numlist_info(int &num_codestreams, int &num_layers,
                       bool &applies_to_rendered_result) const;
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Use this function to determine whether or not the node is
           represented by a number list.  A number list is a list of
           image entities: codestreams; compositing layers; or the
           complete "rendered result".  In many cases, the number list
           information is derived from a JPX number list (`nlst') box.
           However, it can also be derived by the containment of metadata
           within a JPX codestream header box or compositing layer header
           box.  The ensuing discussion assumes that the function returns
           true, meaning that the node is represented by a number list.
           [//]
           If this is an intermediate node, the number list is at least
           notionally the first sub-box of an association box, and all of
           the node's descendants (both immediate and indirect descendants)
           are deemed to be associated with each and every one of the image
           entities in the number list.
           [//]
           As mentioned above, it is also possible that an intermediate node
           is represented by a number list, without the appearance of an
           actual number list box within the JPX data source.  This happens
           if relevant metadata is encountered while parsing a JPX codestream
           header box or a JPX compositing layer header box.  In this case,
           a "virtual" number list is created, to refer to exactly one
           image entity -- the codestream or compositing layer, whose header
           generated the node.  The node's descendants then represent
           the metadata sub-boxes found within the relevant header.  It is
           important to realize that this kind of "virtual" number list
           can always be written into a JPX file as a real number list box
           within an association box, and indeed the JPX file writer usually
           writes metadata in this way, rather than encapsulating it within
           header boxes.
           [//]
           If this node is a leaf, the number list corresponds to an
           isolated number list (`nlst') box, all by itself.  This is
           semantically less useful, of course, but still legal.
           [//]
           In addition to identifying whether or not the node is represented
           by a number list, this function also provides information
           concerning the number of codestreams and compositing layers which
           are referenced by the number list, and whether or not the
           number list references the complete "rendered result".
           [//]
           IMPORTANT: You need to be aware that the codestream and/or
           compositing layer indices that are explicitly identified by a
           number list may be only a subset of the codestreams or compositing
           layers that the number list conceptually references.  This happens
           if the number list is embedded within a JPX container (i.e., if
           it was parsed from or is to be written within a Compositing Layer
           Extensions box).  JPX containers come with an auto-replication
           procedure that expands upon a set of base compositing layers and/or
           base codestreams.  In this case, the codestream and compositing
           layer indices found within the arrays returned by
           `get_numlist_codestreams' and `get_numlist_layers' must either
           correspond to top-level codestreams or compositing layers in the
           file, or else they must correspond to "base codestreams" or
           "base compositing layers" within the JPX container.  These
           base codestream or layer indices may be interpreted as matching
           additional codestream or compositing layers, according to the
           auto-replication procedure.
           [//]
           For reasons of backward compatibility, this function does not
           return any information about whether or not the number list belongs
           to a JPX container, but you can recover this information (as well
           as the auto-replication parameters) via `get_container_id',
           `get_container_cmap' and `get_container_lmap'.  Considering that
           containers may augment the interpretation of the codestream and
           layer indices returned by `get_numlist_codestreams' and
           `get_numlist_layers', it is recommended that new applications
           try to avoid using those functions.  This is usually possible,
           because the JPX file-support API provides sufficient higher
           level functions that can be used to perform semantic matching and
           retrieval of metadata based on image associations and imagery
           based on metadata associations.  Examples of such semantic
           matching functions include:

           [>>] `jpx_metanode::test_numlist_layer';

         [RETURNS]
           True only if the box is represented by a number list.
         [ARG: num_codestreams]
           Used to return the number of image entities in the number list
           which are codestreams.  This is the number of elements in the
           array returned by `get_numlist_codestreams'.  However, as mentioned
           above, the number list may match additional codestreams if it is
           embedded within a JPX container (see `get_container_cmap' for
           more on this).
         [ARG: num_layers]
           Used to return the number of image entities in the number list
           which are compositing layers.  This is the number of elements in
           the array returned by `get_numlist_layers'.  However, as mentioned
           above, the number list may match additional compositing layers if
           it is embedded within a JPX container (see `get_container_lmap' for
           more on this).
         [ARG: applies_to_rendered_result]
           Used to return a boolean variable, which evaluates to true if the
           number list includes a reference to the complete "rendered result"
           of the JPX data source.  The variable is set to false if the number
           list contains references only to codestreams and/or compositing
           layers.  The actual meaning of the "rendered result" is unclear
           from the JPX specification, but it may refer to any of the
           results produced by applying the compositing instructions in a
           composition (`comp') box, if one is present.  Access to these
           compositing instructions is provided via the `jpx_composition'
           interface.

    KDU_AUX_EXPORT int get_container_lmap(int *base=NULL, int *span=NULL);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function can be used to discover the parameters of the

           associations of a number list node beyond those immediately

           If the function returns 0, the present metanode is not embedded

           [//]
           Whenever a number list is embedded within a JPX container, the
           compositing layer indices that it identifies are required to

                top-level compositing layers -- i.e., 0 <= I < Ltop, where
                Ltop is the number of top-level compositing layers and
                `base' >= Ltop is always satisfied.

           this metanode's descendants or ancestors (apart from the root node
           of the metadata hierarchy, of course).  This is because JPX
           containers correspond to Compositing Layer Extensions boxes, which
           are found only at the top level of a JPX file.

           0 if the current metanode is not embedded within a JPX container.
           Otherwise, the return value R is interpreted as the container
           repetition factor, which is either indefinite (R < 0) or a
           positive integer.  Indefinite repetition is possible only if
           the metanode is embedded within the last JPX container in the
           file, in which case `get_container_id' returns one less than the
           total number of JPX containers in the file.
           [//]
           A return value of R=1 means that there is no repetition, so the
           compositing layer indices returned via `get_numlist_layers' are
           actually a complete record of the compositing layers with which
           the metanode is associated.  However, the above constraints on
           these layer indices still apply, which provides a subtle
           distinction between the case R=1 and R=0 (no container embedding).

           [//]
           Where the number list node records both compositing layer indices
           and codestream indices, the interpretation might not always be
           clear.  Where necessary, Kakadu adopts the interpretation that
           a number list which records compositing layer indices is not
           associated with any other compositing layers than those which
           are listed, even if the other compositing layers involve
           codestreams whose indices appear in the number list.
           [//]
           When constructing JPX metadata, it is strongly recommended that
           you always provide compositing layer associations, rather than
           implying such associations through codestream indices.  This is
           because composited frames are built from compositing instructions
           that reference only compositing layers.  It can be very difficult
           to figure out what composited frames are associated with a given
           codestream, especially if the JPX file is being served remotely
           via JPIP, so that only some of the information is actually
           available within a client's cache.  Codestream associations are
           mostly of interest for augmenting a compositing layer association
           with a description of the specific codestreams (there can be many)
           of the compositing layer to which the association refers.  This is
           important primarily for building region-of-interest descriptions --
           see `get_num_regions'.

           This function is superficially similar to `get_numlist_info'
           in that it identifies the number of codestreams with which
           the number list is associated via the `count' argument.
           [//]
           However, if the number list happens to be embedded within a

           ultimate source of data from which the information is being
           discovered is a dynamic cache.  This is because the number of
           repetitions associated with a final JPX container might grow.
           This can happen if the relevant Compositing Layer Extensions box
           indicates that it has an indefinite repetition factor, in which

           that are discovered within the source.  If the current `count'
           value might change in the future, the function returns false, but
           not before trying to discover as many codestreams as possible

           data that is currently available.

         [RETURNS]
           False if the value of `count' might be larger if this function

           the JPX container, the function converts `stream_idx' into the

    KDU_AUX_EXPORT int compare_numlists(const jpx_metanode rhs) const;
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function provides a uniform convention for ordering metadata
           nodes based on their association with number lists.  The idea is
           that a metadata node that is associated with an earlier codestream
           or compositing layer should notionally precede one that is
           associated with a later codestream or compositing layer, no matter
           how the metadata appears within the actual file.  Of course, in
           practice, number lists can represent multiple codestreams and/or
           compositing layers so the comparison is not so straightforward.
           [//]
           The function works as follows.
           [>>] First, it effectively invokes `get_numlist_container' on the
                current node and the `rhs' node to find the most immediate
                ancestor of each node that is a number list, unless that
                node is already a number list.  If neither node is found
                to be associated with a number list, the function returns 0.
                If only one of the nodes is found to be associated with a
                number list, the function considers the number list associated
                node to be greater than the other one; this means that the
                function returns 1 if `rhs' is not associated with a number
                list and -1 if the current node is not associated with a
                number list.  If both nodes are associated with a number list,
                the ensuing comparisons are performed.
           [>>] The first comparison is between JPX container id's; to this
                end, the function effectively evaluates delta =
                `get_container_id' - `rhs.get_container_id', returning the
                value of delta if it is non-zero.  If zero, the ensuing
                comparisons are performed.
           [>>] The function considers number lists that are associated with
                the "rendered result" (see `get_numlist_info') to precede
                number lists that are not.  If both number lists have the
                same "rendered result" association, the ensuing comparisons
                are performed.
           [>>] The function compares each number list's set of compositing
                layers, treated as ordered strings -- see below.  If this
                yields a difference.
           [>>] If the order still cannot be decided, the function compares
                each number list's set of codestreams, treated as ordered
                strings -- see below.
           [//]
           In the above, we used the term "ordered string".  An ordered string
           is formed by concatenating a sequence of numbers (codestream or
           compositing layer indices, as appropriate) in numerically
           increasing order.  A string is considered to be greater than
           another if a standard text comparison algorithm would treat it as
           such.  That is, entries are compared one by one, until a difference
           is found, at which point the function emits the difference between
           the differing entries, treating a missing entry as -1.
         [RETURNS]
           0 if the two nodes cannot be distinguished based on number list
           associations.  Otherwise, the return value is +ve if the current
           node is considered to be greater than (or logically proceed) the
           `rhs' node and -ve if the current node is considered to be smaller
           than (or logically precede) the `rhs' node.

         [SYNOPSIS]
           Returns a pointer to the internal array of regions (and their
           attributes) associated with an ROI description box.
           [//]
           The `jpx_roi' object provides extensive tools for interpreting
           and manipulating regions of interest.  You should be aware that
           regions of interest are generally associated with one or more
           codestreams and, optionally, one or more compositing layers via an
           associated number list node.  Moreover, the geometrical coordinates
           of the various regions are to be interpreted with respect to the
           relevant codestream's high resolution grid, expressed relative to
           the upper left hand corner of the image (as defined by the
           compressed codestream).  This upper left hand image corner is
           usually, but not always the origin of the grid.
           [//]
           It is legal for a JPX file to contain an ROI description box whose
           regions are not associated with any codestream or compositing layer.
           In that case, the geometric coordinates are expressed with respect
           to the upper left hand corner of the composited image.  However,
           we do not recommend this usage, since it leads to regions of
           interest that have no meaning without full composition.  Moreover,
           it leads to regions of interest which are fundamentally not
           connected with the underlying imagery.  There seems to be little or
           no value in allowing applications to create new JPX regions of
           interest whcih have no associated codestream, so we deliberately
           do not support this.  Nevertheless, existing regions of this
           form may have to be handled by readers.
           [//]
           To find the number list to which a region of interest applies (as
           noted above, there should be one, but might possibly not be), the
           application should search through the ancestors of the current
           node for the first one whose `get_numlist_info' function returns
           true.  Since this is a common operation, the present object provides
           a special function `get_numlist_container' that can do this for you.

           This function provides a convenient (and potentially expandable)
           mechanism to identify semantic links between elements in the
           metanode hierarchy.  At present, any node satisfying all of the
           following conditions is considered to be a link:
           [>>] The node must be represented by a cross-reference box.
           [>>] The cross-reference box's fragment list must identify exactly
                one contiguous range of bytes from the same original file.
           [>>] The cross-reference box must point to the box associated with
                another node in the metanode hierarchy; for nodes with
                descendants, it may point either to the association box or
                to the node's immediate box, which is necessarily the first
                sub-box of its association box.  It is illegal for
                cross-reference boxes to point to other cross-reference boxes,
                but a link node might effectively reference another link node
                if that node has a containing asoc box.
           [//]
           If all the above conditions are satisfied, the function sets the
           `link_type' argument to one of `JPX_GROUPING_LINK',
           `JPX_ALTERNATE_CHILD_LINK' or `JPX_ALTERNATE_PARENT_LINK', the
           interpretations of which are given below, returning the target of
           the link or an empty interface (if the target of the link cannot
           be completely read).
           [//]
           It is important to remember that when the ultimtae source of data
           is a dynamic cache, the function may initially be unable to resolve
           a link.  If the first two conditions above are satisfied, but the
           target of the link has not yet been resolved, so long as the
           `try_to_resolve' argument is true, the function will attempt to
           resolve the target by parsing a minimal set of boxes that have not
           yet been completely parsed.  It does this by recursively descending
           into the metadata hierarchy, following and parsing only those
           nodes whose byte range encloses that found in the cross-reference
           box.  If the function determines that there can be no valid
           link target, it sets `link_type' to `JPX_METANODE_LINK_NONE' and
           returns an empty interface.  It does the same if the
           `try_to_resolve' argument is false and no target has yet been
           resolved.  However, if `try_to_resolve' is true and the function's
           attempt to resolve the target of a potential link was inconclusive
           (i.e., more data must be received in the ultimate data dynamic
           cache before a conclusion can be reached), the function sets
           `link_type' to `JPX_METANODE_LINK_PENDING' and returns an
           empty interface.
           [//]
           It is worth summarizing the above description from an alternate
           perspective.  When the ultimate source of data is a dynamic cache,
           there are two potentially transitory conditions that may cause
           the function to return an empty interface:
           [>>] The node is known to hold a link to another (target) node,
                but that link target has not itself cannot be completely read.
                Note that if this is the case, the function does actually
                attempt to parse the link target here, so as to take advantage
                of any newly arrived data.  If this fails to recover the
                identity and contents of the link's target node, the function
                returns an empty interface, but it sets `link_type' to one
                of `JPX_GROUPING_LINK', `JPX_ALTERNATE_CHILD_LINK' or
                `JPX_ALTERNATE_PARENT_LINK', from which the caller may infer
                that the link has been resolved.
           [>>] The node is known to contain a cross-reference to a single
                contiguous region within the same file, that might or might
                not correspond to another metadata node.  If `try_to_resolve'
                is false, the function makes no attempt to resolve this byte
                range into a link target and simply sets `link_type' to
                `JPX_METANODE_LINK_NONE'.  If the link is subsequently resolved
                (e.g., through a call to `jpx_meta_manager::load_matches' or
                while executing any of the other functions that perform
                parsing on demand -- notably, `get_next_descendant' and
                `get_prev_descendant'), the current node will be added to the
                list of touched nodes, from which it can be discovered using
                `jpx_meta_manager::get_touched_nodes'.  If, however,
                `try_to_resolve' is true, the function will make an attempt
                here to resolve the cross-referenced byte range into a link
                target, which may yield a valid link target, may find that
                there is no valid link target, or may remain inconclusive.
                In the last case, and only then, the function will set
                `link_type' to the special value `JPX_METANODE_LINK_PENDING'.
                The function may be called again at a later time in an attempt
                to resolve the pending link or determine it to be
                unresolvable.  Alternatively, the application may wait until
                other parsing activities add the node to the touched list
                from which the application might later retrieve it via
                `jpx_meta_manager::get_touched_nodes'.
         [RETURNS]
           An empty interface if any of the following hold:
           [>>] The present node is not a cross-reference; or
           [>>] The present node is a cross-reference which cannot (at least
                for the moment) be resolved as a link to another node in
                the metadata hierarchy; or
           [>>] The present node is a link to another node in the metadata
                hierarchy, but the linked node cannot yet be completely
                read -- in this last case, `link_type' will be set to the
                correct link type, as opposed to `JPX_METANODE_LINK_NONE'.
         [ARG: link_type]
           Used to return one of the following link types, providing
           additional semantics, which are inferred by Kakadu based on
           reasonable assumptions concerning cross-referencing and the
           use of asoc boxes:
           [>>] `JPX_METANODE_LINK_NONE' -- the present node is not a
                cross-reference box or else the cross-reference cannot
                (at least for the moment) be resolved as a link to another
                node in the metadata hierarchy.
           [>>] `JPX_METANODE_LINK_PENDING' -- the present node is a
                cross-reference box that references a single contiguous region
                within the same file that might potentially correspond to
                another node in the metadata hierarchy with one of the link
                types described below; however, despite the fact that an
                attempt has been made to resolve the link target (the
                `try_to_resolve' argument must be true to get this value for
                `link_type'), the status of the potential link remains
                unresolved.
           [>>] `JPX_GROUPING_LINK' -- if the cross-reference box itself is
                the first sub-box of an `asoc' (association) box, Kakadu
                interprets it as a grouping link.  A grouping link serves to
                identify the remaining boxes in the `asoc' box as members of
                a group associated with the link target.  In the `jpx_metanode'
                hierarchy, these additional boxes are represented as the
                descendants of the link node.  If some of these descendants
                are themselves grouping links, their descendants belong to
                multiple groups.  Non-grouping links are necessarily leaves
                in the `jpx_metanode' tree hierarchy.  Grouping link nodes
                are particularly special because they can be the target of
                other links -- this is because the only way to arrange for
                a cross-reference box to refer to a link node is to refer to
                the node's containing `asoc' box (IS15444-2 makes it illegal
                for cross-references to point to other cross-reference boxes).
                If the target node of a grouping link is represented by the
                first sub-box of an `asoc' box, the grouping link points to
                this first sub-box, rather than the `asoc' box.  This means
                that grouping link nodes may not point to other grouping
                link nodes.  This may at first seem to be a weakness, but
                if the first sub-box of an `asoc' box could point to an
                association box, that would be tantamount to allowing the
                first sub-box of an `asoc' box to be another `asoc' box,
                which is a semantically troublesome situation that Kakadu
                deliberately does not support.  Nevertheless, grouping link
                nodes can refer to each other by means of descendants with
                the `JPX_ALTERNATE_CHILD_LINK' type (see below).
           [>>] `JPX_ALTERNATE_CHILD_LINK' -- if the link node is a leaf
                (hence not a grouping link) and its cross-reference box
                points to an `asoc' box or to another leaf node (i.e., to any
                box which is not the first sub-box of an `asoc' box), the link
                target is interpreted as an alternate child of the link node's
                parent.  This interpretation agrees exactly with what would
                happen if the file parser transparently walked into the
                cross-reference box as though it were a local sub-box of
                the `asoc' box currently being parsed.  Note that alternate
                child links can legally point to other link nodes, so long
                as they are grouping links -- because the cross-reference
                box in this case points to an asoc box rather than another
                cross-reference box.  As mentioned above, this can be a
                useful way of explicitly linking members of the same group
                together.  Let A and B be two grouping link nodes that point
                to the same target T.  Thus, all descendants of A and B are
                considered to belong to the same group, identified by T.  If
                we want to ensure that T can discover its members A and B,
                we just need to add alternate child links to T that point to
                A and B.  Alternatively, if we want to build links directly
                between A and B, we can add alternate child links to A and B
                as descendants of B and A, respectively.  Alternate child
                links to grouping link nodes makes perfect senese, from a
                semantic perspective.  It means that that all the descendants
                of A and B could be imported as descendants of T (in the first
                case) or all the descendants of B could be imported as
                descendants of A or vice-versa (in the second case)
                their meaning, or vice-versa, all of which preserves the
                association semantics.  These kind of link arrangements can
                easily create cyclic loops, so you should be careful about
                following links indefintely.  Kakakdu's own API functions
                take care to avoid looping indefinitely while traversing
                the metadata graph.
           [>>] `JPX_ALTERNATE_PARENT_LINK' - if the link node is a leaf
                (hence not a grouping link) and its cross-reference box
                points to the first sub-box of an `asoc' box, the link target
                is interpreted as an alternate parent of the link node's
                parent.  Where alternate parents exist, they are normally
                used to form bi-directional links between two nodes A and B,
                as follows: A(...Lc->B...) and B(...Lp->A...).  Here,
                A and B are each the first sub-box of their respective `asoc'
                boxes and parentheses are used to represent their descendants
                (non-initial sub-boxes of the asoc box); Lc->B is an
                alternate child link to node B (its cross-reference box points
                to B itself) and Lp->A is an alternate parent link to node A
                (is cross-reference box points to the `asoc' box headed by A).
                This arrangement allows A and B to discover each other with
                their proper relationships and should cause no problems for
                file readers which are not aware of Kakadu's interpretation.
                The arrangement is also very useful in JPIP browsing
                applications, since it forces a server to deliver A in any
                context where B must be expanded and vice-versa.  Evidently,
                alternate-parent links may not point to other link nodes,
                since that would require the cross-reference box to reference
                another cross-reference box (illegal under IS15444-2).
         [ARG: try_to_resolve]
           If true, the function makes an attempt to resolve the target of
           a potential link by attempting to parse relevant boxes in the
           hierarchy, to the extent that the ultimate data source permits.
           If the attempt to resolve the link remains inconclusive (and only
           in this case), the function sets `link_type' to
           `JPX_METANODE_LINK_PENDING'.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           From Kakadu version 7.0, there is a much better way to walk through
           descendants of a node than counting them and then invoking
           `get_descendant' with an index.  The counting function is
           inefficient, and almost always unnecessary.  Instead, you are
           recommended to consider `get_next_descendant' as a primary tool
           for examining descendants of a metanode.
           [//]
           If the number of descendants from this node is already
           known, this function returns true, writing that number into `count'.
           The number may not be known only if the ultimate source of
           information for a JPX data source is a dynamic cache whose
           contents have not been fully written (say by a remote JPIP
           server).  In this case, the function attempts to parse as far
           as it can into the super-box whose contents define the descendants
           of this node (the super-box is either an `asoc' box, or a
           codestream or compositing layer header box).  If it encounters
           the end of the relevant super-box, the function again returns
           true, writing the number of descendants into `count'.
           [//]
           If the function is unable to parse to a point at which the number
           of descendants can be known, it returns false, writing the
           number of descendants encountered up to that point into the
           `count' argument.
           [//]
           Since this function may perform parsing, there is always a chance
           that the internal parsing machinery invokes an internal
           "safe delete" operation, so that a subsequent call to
           `is_deleted' returns true.
           [//]
           Note that leaf nodes never have descendants, so this function
           will always return true with `count' set to 0.

           False if it is possible that more descendants remain in the
           underlying JPX data source, but the function is unable to parse
           any further into the source at this point.  This generally means
           that the underlying `jp2_family_src' object is fueled by a
           dynamic cache (i.e., a `kdu_cache' object).
      */
    KDU_AUX_EXPORT jpx_metanode get_descendant(int which);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           You may use this function to access each descendant of a node.
           However, the index `which' associated with a descendant
           has no absolute meaning.  In particular, if the ultimate source of
           data is a dynamic cache, the arrival of more data may potentially
           introduce a previously unknown descendant between two descendants
           that were previously known.  In this case, the index `which' that
           is used to retrieve the latter of these previously known descendants
           will now be different.  In other words, `which' is the ordinal
           position of the descendant within an internal list that may
           change in unpredictable ways as the contents of the dynamic cache
           grow.  You can be assured, however, that this will not happen
           until the next call to `count_descendants', `get_next_descendant',
           `get_prev_descendant' or `jpx_meta_manager::load_matches'.
           [//]
           To avoid any problems which might be incurred by assigning too
           strong an interpretation to the `which' argument, you should only
           use this function for scanning through all descendants in a tight
           loop -- rather than building upon a previously scanned list.
           Moreover, you are recommended to use the more informative functions
           `get_next_descendant' and `get_prev_descendant', which not only
           allow you to traverse the list of descendants more intuitively,
           but also automatically attempt to parse previously unavailable
           descendants and allow you to determine whether or not there are
           missing descendants that may become available later once a dynamic
           cache receives more data.
           [//]
           If `which' is greater than or equal to the number of
           descendants, the function returns an empty interface.
           Even if `which' identifies a known descendant, the function may
           return an empty interface if the descendant's box contents cannot
           yet be read -- for descendants which are leaf nodes, this means
           that the relevant box could not be completely read; for descendants
           which are intermediate nodes, it means that the asoc box header or
           the first sub-box of the asoc box could not be completely read.
           Incomplete reading like this occurs only where the ultimate source
           of data is a dynamic cache.
           [//]
           Note carefully that from Kakadu version 7.0, this function hides
           (by default) any structuring boxes which might have been used to
           group descendants into collections which have no semantic meaning
           (the primary reason for doing this is efficient transport by
           JPIP).  The primary structuring box is the JPX Grouping (`grp_')
           box, but Asoc boxes with a `free' box as first sub-box can also
           be used for semantic-free grouping (we call these "free-asocs").
           What this means is that the descendants of hidden structuring boxes
           are treated as if they were immediate descendants of the current
           node.  This behaviour allows the application to completely ignore
           the presence of structuring boxes, which is generally desirable.
           However, one consequence of this is that groups that cannot yet
           be expanded (due to an incomplete dynamic cache as the source of
           data) may hold any number of missing descendants, that may lie
           between known descendants.  If this is important (e.g., when
           exploring hierarchically decomposed XML), you are advised to use
           the `get_next_descendant' and `get_prev_descendant' to traverse

                          const kdu_uint32 *box_types=NULL);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function is typically more efficient and flexible than
           either `get_descendant' or `find_descendant_by_type'.  The
           function looks for an immediate descendant of the current node
           that follows `ref'.  If `ref' is an empty interface the function
           starts searching from the beginning of the descendants list.  The
           `limit_cmd' and `box_types' arguments allow you to customize what
           the function searches for.  If `limit_cmd' is 0, the function
           looks for the UNIQUE descendant which immediately follows `ref', or
           else the first immediate descendant (if `ref' is empty), returning
           an empty interface if that descendant does not exist; the
           descendant may not exist because it has not yet been parsed from
           a dynamic cache whose contents are insufficient (or you have not
           invoked `jpx_meta_manager::load_matches' since the contents grew).
           If `limit_cmd' is -ve, the function searches for ANY immediate
           descendant that is available and follows `ref', skipping over any
           descendants that have yet to be parsed from the dynamic cache.
           Positive values of `limit_cmd' are used with the `box_types'
           array, as explained below.
           [//]
           Unlike `get_descendant' and `find_descendant_by_type', this
           function attempts to parse as far as it can into the super-box
           (or super-boxes) whose contents define the descendants.  This
           is important if the ultimate source of data is a dynamic cache
           (typically when using JPIP to interact with a remote source).
           This is also what `count_descendants' does.  We cannot do this
           inside `get_descendant' or related functions because the parsing
           of new boxes might alter the interpretation of the descendant
           `which' index in an unpredictable manner.  This is one of the
           many reasons for recommending that applications always use the
           present function in place of `get_descendant'.
           [//]
           As explained in connection with `get_descendant' you should bear
           in mind that structuring boxes (grouping boxes or free-asoc boxes)
           that are used to group descendants into collections without any
           semantic meaning are automatically expanded in a manner that is
           transparent to the application -- customizable via the
           `jpx_meta_manager::set_behaviour' function.  Thus, two consecutive
           immediate descendants may potentially lie within different
           expanded grouping or free-asoc boxes; this is the semantic intent
           behind JPX grouping ("grp_") boxes.  When the ultimate source of
           data is a dynamic cache, it can happen that some such grouping
           boxes are not yet available so that there are gaps (typically of
           unknown length) in the immediate descendant list.  With the
           `get_descendant' function, it is not possible to detect such
           gaps.  However, the present function allows you to either ignore
           such gaps (-ve `limit_cmd' value) or to detect the gaps (`limit_cmd'
           equal to 0).
           [//]
           Since this function may perform parsing, there is always a chance
           that the internal parsing machinery invokes an internal
           "safe delete" operation, so that a subsequent call to
           `is_deleted' returns true.
         [RETURNS]
           An empty interface, if no suitable descendant of the current node
           can be found.  If non-empty, the returned object is always an
           immediate descendant of the current node, noting that the
           internal machinery recursively expands grouping and free-asoc boxes
           (depending on the behaviour set by
           `jpx_meta_manager::set_behaviour') so that they contribute
           immediate descendants to their container.
         [ARG: ref]
           If this is an empty interface the function starts searching for an
           appropriate metanode, starting from the first immediate descendant
           of the current node.  Otherwise, it searches for descendants of
           the current node that follow `ref'.  If `ref' is a non-empty
           interface, but is not an immediate descendant of the current node,
           the function returns an empty interface, regardless of the
           `limit_cmd' value.
         [ARG: limit_cmd]
           One of three types of values, as follows:
           [>>] 0 means that the function returns only the immediate successor
                of `ref' or the true first immediate descendant of the current
                node (if `ref' is empty).  If the descendant in question does
                not yet exist, the function returns an empty interface, even
                if later descendants are available.
           [>>] A -ve value means that the function returns the first
                available successor of `ref' or the first available
                descendant of the current node (if `ref' is empty).  An empty
                interface is returned if there are currently no immediate
                descendants that follow `ref'.
           [>>] A +ve value is used together with the `box_types' array to
                search for the next immediate successor of `ref' (or the first
                descendant of the current node, if `ref' is empty) that
                matches one of the box types identified in the `box_types'
                array.  If `box_types' is NULL, an empty interface will
                invariably be returned.
         [ARG: box_types]
           Used with +ve values of the `limit_cmd' value.  If `limit_cmd' is
           positive, this array must contain at least `limit_cmd' entries.
           The function searches for the a descendant that follows `ref'
           (if non-empty) and that matches one of these box types.

           to be stable within a single open instance of the `jpx_source'

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This powerful function is intended to help you discover semantic
           connections between nodes within the metadata graph, by traversing
           parent/child links as well as the various types of inter-node
           links which can be discovered by `get_link' and `enum_linkers'.
           [//]
           The function tries to find a path emanating from the current node
           and terminating at the `target' node.  It is obvious that all
           nodes are ultimately connected by following an ascending path from
           the source node up to the root of the metanode hierarchy and then
           descending back down to the target node.  By contrast, the paths
           examined by the present function are those which involve a (possibly
           empty) descending portion, followed by a (possibly empty) ascending
           portion.
           [//]
           The descending portion passes through descendants, but
           can also follow alternate child links in the forward direction
           (using `get_link') or alternate parent links in the reverse
           direction (using `enum_linkers').
           [//]
           The ascending portion passes from children to parents, but can
           also follow alternate parent links in the forward direction
           (using `get_link') or alternate child links in the reverse
           direction (using `enum_linkers').
           [//]
           If you examine paths which involve descendants, parents and forward
           links only, you are discovering whether or not `target' is apparent
           from the current node.  If you examine paths which involve
           descendants, parents and reverse links only, you are discovering
           paths whether or not the current node is apparent from `target'.
           [//]
           Along the way, you can exclude paths which traverse links to
           certain types of nodes.  This is particularly interesting
           if you want to discover regions of interest or numlists which are
           related to a specific `target' while excluding paths which
           traverse links to direct descendants of other numlists or regions,
           making those descendants or numlists inherently more relevant
           to the `target'.  The exclusion arguments are irrelevant if the
           function is not configured to traverse links -- i.e., if neither
           `descending_flags' nor `ascending_flags' includes the
           `JPX_PATH_TO_FORWARD' or `JPX_PATH_TO_REVERSE' flags.
           [//]
           The function is robust, even if cycles are encountered in the
           graph created by links and descendant relationships. Paths in
           which such cycles are encountered are excluded.
           [//]
           However, the function can be expensive to execute
           if the current node is connected to numerous other nodes.  Thus,
           rather than executing the function with forward linking options
           from a heavily connected node to a less heavily connected target
           node, it is much better to execute it with reverse linking options
           from the less heavily connected node to the other one as target.
           The successful paths will be the same in both cases, but the
           execution cost much lower.
         [RETURNS]
           The function returns the first intermediate node in any path
           which it found from the current node to the `target' node by
           following the prescription established by the various arguments.
           By re-invoking the function on that node you can discover each
           successive node in a connecting path.  If no path was found, the
           function returns an empty interface.
         [ARG: descending_flags]
           Presribes the graph branches which can be followed during the
           descending portion of any successful path, via a logical OR of

           Number of elements in each of the `exclusion_box_types'
           and `exclusion_flags' arrays.
         [ARG: exclusion_box_types]
           Box types used by exclusion rules -- see `exclusion_flags' for
           how these are used.
         [ARG: exclusion_flags]
           Controls the way in which each box type in `exclusion_box_types'
           is treated.  Each entry in the array is a logical OR of one or more
           of the following flags:
           [>>] `JPX_PATH_TO_EXCLUDE_BOX' -- exclude any path which traverses
                a link to a node which has the associated box type.
           [>>] `JPX_PATH_TO_EXCLUDE_PARENTS' -- exclude any path which
                traverses a link to a node which is descended from one with
                the associated box type.
         [ARG: unify_groups]
           If true, the function regards all nodes grouped together via
           grouping links (see the explanation of `JPX_GROUPING_LINK' under
           `get_link') as synonymous so long as `target' is one of these
           nodes.  That is, if `target' is a grouping link node, then any
           path which reaches the grouping link target or any other node
           which has the same grouping link target will be considered
           acceptable.  Any path which reaches a grouping link node
           which points to `target' is also considered acceptable.
           [//]
           Note that the `unify_groups' option is just a way of broadening the
           interpretation of the `target'; it does not represent the traversal
           of grouping links during the ascending or descending path phases.

           are not yet accessible.

           Note also that this may possibly delete the node's original parent.
           This only happens if the parent is determined to be useless as
           a result of having no children.  Currently, the only case in which

           Note also that changing a node's parent may have a dramatic
           impact on the interpretation of number lists (including descendant
           number lists) if either of the old and new parent nodes are
           embedded within a JPX container (see `get_container_id').  An

           represented as an isolated number list box, all by itself.
           [//]
           From KDU-7.2, it is possible to embed number lists within JPX
           containers (Compositing Layer Extensions boxes).  As explained
           with `get_numlist_info', this affects the interpretation of the
           codestream and compositing layer indices that are identified by
           the number list.  In particular, if a number list is embedded in a
           JPX container, the codestreams and compositing layers
           to which the number list refers include not only those that are
           supplied via the `codestream_indices' and `layer_indices' arrays,
           but additional codestreams and compositing layers that are
           generated by an auto-replication procedure.  The auto-replication
           procedure depends on the JPX container itself and is explained
           in the comments accompanying `get_numlist_info'.
           [//]
           A number list added using this function will be embedded in a
           JPX container if you call the function with a non-negative
           `container_id' or if the current node or any of its ancestors is
           embedded in a JPX container.  In any of these cases, the
           compositing layer and codestream indices supplied via
           `layer_indices' and `codestream_indices' are required to satisfy
           the following constraints (these constraints are checked and
           offending indices will result in a `kdu_error' message):
           [>>] Each codestream index either refers to a top-level codestream
                (see `jpx_container_source::get_num_top_codestreams' or
                `jpx_container_target::get_num_top_codestreams') or else it
                must correspond to one of the codestreams defined by the
                container.  In the latter case, the codestream index is NOT
                REQUIRED to be one of the container's base codestreams
                (see `jpx_container_source::get_base_codestreams' or
                `jpx_container_target::get_base_codestreams') BUT a non-base
                index will be automatically converted to the corresponding
                base index.
           [>>] Each compositing layer index either refers to a top-level
                layer (see `jpx_container_source::get_num_top_layers' or
                `jpx_container_target::get_num_top_layers') or else it must
                correspond to one of the compositing layers defined by the
                container.  In the latter case, the layer index is NOT
                REQUIRED to be one of the container's base compositing layers
                (see `jpx_container_source::get_base_layers' or
                `jpx_container_target::get_base_layers') BUT a non-base
                index will be automatically converted to the corresponding
                base index.
           [//]
           Note that the above constraints apply even if `container_id' is
           negative, so long as the current node or any of its ancestors is
           embedded in a JPX container.  You can always discover such embedding
           by calling `get_container_id'.
           [//]
           The only way to introduce a new container-embedded metanode is
           to call this present function, with a non-negative `container_id'
           argument.  In this case, the current object must be the root of
           the metadata hierarchy -- see `jpx_meta_manager::access_root'.
           This is because JPX containers (Compositing Layer Extensions boxes)
           must appear at the top level of a JPX file.  If you want the
           auto-replication benefits of container embedding without having
           to insert a meaningful number list at the top level of the file,
           this can be achieved by setting all other arguments of this
           function to NULL/false.  This declares a container-embedded
           number list that has no associations of its own and so will not
           actually result in the generation of a number list box when
           writing a file, but ensures that all descendant metanodes have
           the container-embedding property.

           True if the number list is to contain a reference to the "rendered
           result".  See `get_numlist_info' for a discussion of the meaning
           of the rendered result.
         [ARG: container_id]
           This argument may be non-negative only if the current interface
           corresponds to the root of the metadata hierarchy -- obtained
           using `jpx_meta_manager::access_root'.  Moreover, if non-negative,
           `container_id' must be the identifier of an existing JPX container,
           (see `jpx_container_source::get_container_id' or
           `jpx_container_target::get_container_id') and all compositing layer
           and codestream indices supplied in this call must conform to the
           container-specific constraints that are listed above.

           tree (see `get_link') or is linked by some other object in
           its metadata tree, the behaviour depends on whether or not the
           current node belongs to the same metadata manager:
           [>>] If `src' belongs to a different metadata manager and contains
                links or is linked from elsewhere, the copying process
                attempts to reproduce these links.  Specifically, a copied
                link attempts to resolve itself with a copy of the object
                that `src' was linked to.  If it cannot do so immediately,
                internal machinery is set up to make sure that the copied link
                will resolve itself to a copy of the object to which `src'
                was linked if and when such a copy becomes available in the
                future.  Until such resolution takes place, the copied
                object's `jpx_metanode::get_link' function will returns an
                empty interface, although `jpx_metanode::get_box_type' will
                identify the copied object as a cross-reference box
                (`jp2_cross_reference_4cc').
           [>>] If `src' is a link and it belongs to the same metadata
                manager as the link being copied, the copied object will be
                a link to the same `jpx_metanode' as `src'.  However, if the
                `link_to_internal_copies' argument is true, the behaviour
                described above, for different metadata managers, is
                reproduced.
           [//]
           If the current object is the root of its metadata hierarchy and
           `src' is a number list node that is embedded within a JPX
           container, the copied metanode will also be embedded within a
           JPX container that has the same container index (or identifier).
           That is, the added metanode's `get_container_id' function
           should return the same value as the current object's
           `get_container_id' function.  For this to work correctly, when
           the `src' and current nodes belong to different `jpx_meta_manager's,
           the containers must exist and be identical in both objects.  If
           not, an error will be generated through `kdu_error'.
         [RETURNS]
           This function may possibly return an empty interface, if no copy
           of the node was actually added.  This happens if you attempt to
           copy a cross-reference node (see `get_cross_reference') which does
           not link to another known node (see `get_link').  It also happens
           if you attempt to copy a link node (in the sense of `get_link')
           whose link target has been deleted.
         [ARG: recursive]
           If true, the `src' node's descendants will be copied recursively.
           While doing so, the function will attempt to parse as many of
           the descendant boxes as possible -- if the source is fuelled
           ultimately by a dynamic cache, the descendants of an available
           node may grow, as more data arrives from a remote server.
         [ARG: link_to_internal_copies]
           This argument affects the behaviour only when `src' has the same
           metadata manager as the current object and `src' is a link (i.e.,
           `src.get_link' returns a non-empty interface).  In this case,
           the default policy is to create a new link which points back to
           the same metanode as `src'.  However, if this argument is true,
           the behaviour is to link the new metanode to the most recent
           copy of the link target, or to leave the link unresolved until such
           a copy becomes available.
           [//]
           This creates a powerful mechanism for duplicating complex
           metadata graphs during editing operations.  However, if a given
           collection of metadata is copied multiple times, links may
           accidentally be formed to unintended copies; this can happen if
           a previously copied metanode has not yet had an opportunity to be
           recopied by the time a link to the copy needs to be resolved.
           [//]
           To avoid the potential pitfalls described above, you are strongly
           advised to invoke the `jpx_meta_manager::reset_copy_locators'
           function before copying metadata wtihin the same metadata manager
           with the `link_to_internal_copies' argument set to true.
           [//]
           After copying a partial collection of metanodes from the
           metadata hierarchy with `link_to_internal_copies' set to true,
           it is possible that some link metanodes remain unresolved --
           because their targets were never copied.  The caller may wish to
           make a subsequent sweep through the copied metadata setting any
           such unresolved links to point back to their original source --
           usually the best practice during editing operations.

                       int qualifier=KDU_MRQ_ALL);
      /*[SYNOPSIS]
          The purpose of this function is to invoke the
          `kdu_window::add_metareq' function, as needed, to request additional
          metadata for the current node and/or its descendants.
          [//]
          It is easiest to understand the function if we first ignore any
          recursion -- i.e., if `num_descend_box_types' is 0. In this case,
          the purpose of the function is to issue the metadata requests
          required to determine the number of descendants, the box-type of
          each descendant, and the contents of each immediate descendant
          whose box-type matches one of the `num_box_types_of_interest'
          types in the `box_types_of_interest' array.  In the special case
          where `num_box_types_of_interest' is 0, the caller is assumed to be
          interested in all box-types.  In the event that one of the boxes of
          interest is a cross-reference box, the function issues a request
          for the box even if its contents are fully available, if the target
          location of the cross-reference cannot yet be resolved to a JPIP
          data-bin; this is because JPIP servers are obliged to send both
          the cross-reference and sufficient box headers to locate the
          reference target.
          [//]
          Note that the function only issues metadata requests sufficient to
          recover the immediate descendants of the current node, with one
          of the box-types of interest.  It is possible that the request must
          be generated in a manner which encompasses more data than required.
          It is also possible that the server will send more data than required
          even if the request is very tight.  Nevertheless, the intent is to
          generate requests which recover the box contents of all relevant
          child nodes, not including their own descendants (if they have any).
          [//]
          There is one subtle, yet valuable exception to the above.  In the
          event that an immediate descendant of the current node is an empty
          number list (i.e., a number list that references no codestreams,
          compositing layers or the rendered result), its descendants are
          considered to reside at the same level from the perspective of
          this function; accordingly, the function requests information
          sufficient to access the immediate descendants of all empty
          number lists as well -- in fact, empty number lists are followed
          recursively.  The reason for treating the descendants of empty
          number lists as though they were siblings of the number list is
          that such nodes provide no semantics of their own.  Empty number
          lists may be used to represent the embedding of descendant metadata
          within a JPX container.  However, such embedding does not modify
          the semantics of the metadata until an embedded non-empty number
          list is encountered.
          [//]
          An additional powerful feature of this function is the ability to
          descend into a defined subset of the node's children, recursively
          re-applying itself to each such descendant which is available.  The
          `num_descend_box_types' and `descend_box_types' members are used to
          specify the box-types of the boxes you are interested in visiting
          during this recursive process.  We do not currently provide any
          means of stating that you wish to recursively descend into all
          children, regardless of box-type, partly because this might be
          reckless.  In most cases, where recursion is desired, the set of
          `descend_box_types' would be identical to `box_types_of_interest'.
          [//]
          Note that this function may request metadata which is already
          available, since it does not automatically parse any new data
          which may have arrived in the cache.  As a general rule, you
          should use this function in conjunction with
          `jpx_meta_manager::load_matches'.
        [RETURNS]
          The number of distinct calls to `client_window->add_metareq' which
          were generated by the function.  This value might be 0 if all
          relevant descendants are available already. The function takes
          advantage of internal state information to rapidly dismiss nodes
          whose descendants are already fully available.
        [ARG: client_window]
          Object whose `kdu_window::add_metareq' function is used to add
          metadata requests for the relevant entities.
        [ARG: num_box_types_of_interest]
          Number of elements in the `box_types_of_interest' array.  If zero,
          the caller is interested in all box-types -- this is represented
          by a `box_type' value of 0 in calls to `kdu_window::add_metareq'.
          Otherwise, you should try to keep the list short, to minimize the
          cost of transmitting metadata requests.
        [ARG: box_types_of_interest]
          Array of box types which are of interest to the caller; may be NULL
          if `num_box_types_of_interest' is 0 or negative.
        [ARG: num_descend_box_types]
          If 0, the function does not recursively descend into children.
          Otherwise, this argument specifies the number of box-types provided
          by the `descend_box_types' array.
        [ARG: descend_box_types]
          Array of box-types, one of which must be matched by any child into
          which this function recursively descends and re-applies itself.
          These box-types need not necessarily be included in the list
          supplied by `box_types_of_interest', but most useful applications
          of the function probably involve `box_types_of_interest' being a
          superset of `descend_box_types'.
        [ARG: priority]
          Same interpretation as its namesake in `kdu_window::add_metareq'.
        [ARG: max_descend_depth]
          Maximum depth to which recursive descent based on `descend_box_types'
          is applied.  A value of 0 or less means that `descend_box_types'
          is ignored (same as if `num_descend_box_types' were 0).  A value of
          1 means the caller is interested in nodes that are immediate
          descendants of any of the current node's immediate descendants that
          matches one of the box-types in `descend_box_types'.
        [ARG: qualifier]
          Provides the `qualifier' argument to be passed to
          `kdu_window::add_metareq' for each generated metadata request.  You
          should almost invariably use the default value of `KDU_MRQ_ALL'
          here, since otherwise, there is no guarantee that you will
          eventually be able to recover all relevant elements from the
          metadata tree.   The main exception to this is when invoking this
          function from the root of the entire metadata tree.  In this
          case, it can be useful to use `KDU_MRQ_GLOBAL' for the `qualifier'
          in order to explicitly avoid recovering number lists
          and ROI boxes -- in some cases there may be a very large number of
          these at the top level of the file.

           If `get_link' reports a `jpx_metanode_link_type' value of

           at least we are not able to discover whether or not it is a link
           node yet) and so the function does nothing.
           [//]
           In the first instance, the function generates sufficient
           metadata requests to obtain the information required for
           `get_link' to return a non-empty target node, unless the target

           be determined to match both one of the required box types and
           one of the box types in the `descend_box_types' array, the
           function effectively applies `generate_metareq' to the link target,
           passing all of its arguments through to their namesakes in that
           function.
         [RETURNS]
           The number of calls to `client_window->add_metareq' issued by the
           function.  If the function returns 0 and `get_link' continues to

           the target of the link has a box-type other than one of those
           given by `num_box_types_of_interest' and `box_types_of_interest' --
           it might be able to discover this without actually having sufficient
           data in the caching source to read the contents of the target node's

           target of any link represented by the current node is known to
           have a box-type which differs from all of these box-types
           (and `num_box_types_of_interest' > 0), the function does not do
           anything.  This argument may be NULL if `num_box_types_of_interest'
           is 0.

           If 0, the function does not generate metadata requests for anything
           other than the target of the link node.  Otherwise, this argument
           specifies the number of box-types provided by the
           `descend_box_types' array.
         [ARG: descend_box_types]
           Array of box-types, one of which must be matched by the target
           of the current link node in order for the function to consider
           generating further metadata requests.  If a match is found,
           `generate_metareq' is invoked on the link's target node.
         [ARG: priority]
           Same interpretation as its namesake in `kdu_window::add_metareq'.
         [ARG: max_descend_depth]
           Same interpretation as its namesake in `kdu_window::add_metareq'.
           Note that a descend depth of 0 or less turns off recursive
           descent (same as setting `num_descend_box_types' to 0).  A value of
           1 means that the function generates metadata requests only for
           the immediate descendants of the target of the link, if the link
           node's box-type matches one of those specified in the
           `descend_box_types' array.
         [ARG: qualifier]
           Same interpretation as its namesake in `kdu_window::add_metareq'.

       This object provides access to the metadata tree managed by the
       `jpx_metanode' interface.  For a thorough discussion of the structure
       and contents of metadata trees, refer to the extensive comments
       appearing with `jpx_metanode'.  You should review these concepts before
       trying to understand the ensuing text.  For more information on the
       exact box types which are represented by the metadata tree, see
       the `set_box_filter' function.
       [//]
       In addition to granting access to the metadata tree, the present
       object adds additional layers of organization on the metadata,
       providing efficient access to boxes of interest and
       facilitating the creation of files whose metadata organization is
       amenable to efficient access in remote client-server applications.
       These extra layers of organization may be complex to describe here
       and are, in any event, transparent to the application and potentially
       subject to change.
       [//]
       Note carefully that objects of the `jpx_meta_manager' class are merely
       interfaces to an internal object, which cannot be directly created
       by an application.  Use `jpx_target::access_meta_manager' or
       `jpx_source::access_meta_manager' to obtain a non-empty interface.

           This function may be used to control the box types which are
           included in the metadata tree as a JPX data source is being
           parsed.  By default, the following box types are included:
           [>>] label boxes (`lbl ')
           [>>] XML boxes (`xml ');
           [>>] IP-rights boxes (`jp2i');

           [>>] ROI description boxes (`roid');
           [>>] UUID boxes (`uuid');
           [//]
           In addition, association (`asoc') and grouping (`grp_') boxes,
           and the first sub-box of every association box, are automatically
           included.
           [//]
           You may change the default set of boxes listed above by providing
           an array of box types to be included.  Note that association boxes
           and their first sub-boxes are always included, regardless of the
           supplied filter.  Apart from this, boxes which do not match the
           filter and which are not otherwise required for rendering imagery,
           will be discarded.  The following box types are currently
           considered to be required for rendering imagery; including them
           in a box filter list will have no effect:
           [>>] JP2 signature (`jP  ');

           If you are going to call this function, you should do so right
           after opening the JPX data source, so as to avoid missing
           or keeping boxes you do not want.
           [//]
           Note that this function has no impact on which boxes you can
           explicitly add to a metadata tree (typically for writing a JPX
           file) via the `insert_node' function or the various interface
           functions offered by `jpx_metanode'.
         [ARG: num_box_types]
           If 0, the `box_types' array is ignored and the filter is
           configured to pass all box types.  Otherwise, only those box
           types specified via the `box_types' array will be parsed.
         [ARG: box_types]
           Array containing `num_box_types' entries.  There are no
           restrictions on the content of this array, but note that some
           box types (those required for rendering imagery) may not appear
           in the metadata tree even if they are specified in this array.

    KDU_AUX_EXPORT void
      set_behaviour(int parsing_behaviour, int writing_behaviour);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function is new to Kakadu version 7.0.  It allows you to
           customize the way in which metadata is parsed and/or written.
           Such customization is provided mainly to support compatibility
           across implementations of the JPX file format metadata that may
           predate new box types introduced into IS15444-2/Amd-2.
           [//]
           A major role for this function is in customizing the way in which
           special structuring boxes are handled by the internal
           implementation.  The special structuring boxes currently considered
           are Grouping (`grp_') boxes and Association (`asoc') boxes whose
           first sub-box is a `free' box -- we call these "free-asoc" boxes.
           These each provide a means of structuring metadata within the file,
           in a way which is intended to be completely semantic free.  There
           is no particular reason why an application should be directly
           interested in these structuring boxes; indeed, the interpretation
           of metadata in the file should be unaltered if the contents of each
           structuring box are moved out of the structuring box -- i.e., by
           flattening the file structure.  On the other hand, it may be that
           third party applications or older versions of Kakadu do not handle
           structuring boxes in a completely transparent way.  This is one
           reason for customizing behaviour via this function.
         [ARG: parsing_behaviour]
           This argument takes a logical OR of flags which affect the way
           JPX metadata content is parsed.  Currently, the only flag defined
           is:
           [>>] `JPX_METAREAD_FLATTEN_FREE_ASOCS' -- If set, Association boxes
                whose first sub-box is a free box (free-asoc boxes) are
                treated in the same way as Grouping boxes -- that is, the
                contents of these boxes are treated as if they were direct
                descendants of the box in which the Association box is found.
                Otherwise, these Association boxes are treated in the usual
                way, signifying a node, whose box type happens to be
                `jp2_free_4cc' and whose remaining sub-boxes are that node's
                descendants.
           [//]
           The `JPX_METAREAD_FLATTEN_FREE_ASOCS' flag is set by default, if
           you never call this function.
         [ARG: writing_behaviour]
           This argument takes a logical OR of flags which affect the way
           JPX metadata content is written.  Currently, the only flag defined
           is:
           [>>] `JPX_METAWRITE_USE_FREE_ASOCS' -- If set, the object uses
                "free-asoc" boxes instead of Grouping boxes, to organize
                large collections of region of interest (ROI) associations
                in an hierarchical manner.  If this flag is missing, this is
                done using JPX Grouping boxes (box type `jp2_group_4cc') --
                moreover, in that case the Grouping boxes are also used
                to structure any large collection of siblings within the
                metadata hierarchy, so as to facilitate efficient piecemeal
                access via JPIP.  You may wish to set the flag if you have
                reason to believe that applications consuming the generated
                content may not understand Grouping boxes.  This is possible,
                because Grouping boxes were only introduced to the standard in
                Ammendment 2 of IS15444-2.  On the other hand, "free-asoc"
                boxes have probably only ever been used by Kakadu-based
                applications, since Kakadu was the first implementation to
                recognize the need for semantic-free structuring.
            [//]
            If you never call this function, the default is to perform
            full structuring with Grouping boxes.

           This function searches for a metanode whose contents were obtained
           by reading a box whose contents are located at `file_pos' in the
           box's original file.
           [//]
           It is useful to remember that a `jpx_metanode' which is obtained
           from an asoc (Association) box directly represents both the
           asoc box and its first sub-box, with any remaining sub-boxes
           interpreted as the node's descendants.  As a result, there are
           two file positions which can be used to locate such a metanode.
         [RETURNS]
           An empty `jpx_metanode' if no match could be found.  In the case
           of input sources which are loaded from a dynamic cache, this
           might mean that you need to wait until the cache contains more
           contents and/or invoke `load_matches' to load any new boxes which
           might have arrived.
         [ARG: file_pos]
           Absolute location of the first byte of the box contents (not its
           header) within the original file to which the box belongs.  If
           the box was read via a cache, you can still obtain the absolute
           location within its original file by adding the box header length
           to the value returned by `jp2_locator::get_file_pos', where
           `jp2_locator' may, for example, be returned by
           `jp2_input_box::get_locator'.  You can obtain the box header length
           by calling `jp2_input_box::get_box_header_length'.

    KDU_AUX_EXPORT jpx_metanode get_touched_nodes();
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
         You can use this function to traverse all nodes in the metadata
         tree which have been created for the first time, deleted,
         changed in any way, or explicitly touched by `jpx_metanode::touch'.
         Once a node is returned by this function, it will not be returned
         again, unless it is again added onto the internal list of touched
         nodes, by one of the following events:
         [>>] If a node's `jpx_metanode::get_link' function could not
              previously follow a link to its target, but now can (i.e., if
              that function returned an empty interface previously but will
              now return a non-empty interface), the node and all of its
              descendants (there are not normally any, unless it is a grouping
              link node) are appended to the internal touched list.
         [>>] If a node is deleted, using `jpx_metanode::delete_node' it
              will be appended to the internal list of touched nodes.  Of
              course, its descendants will also be deleted and appended to
              the list.  Remember that deleted nodes are not physically
              deleted from memory; one good reason for this is to enable
              applications to track such deletions via the present function.
              See `is_deleted'.
         [>>] If a node's ancestry is changed by `jpx_metanode::change_parent'
              the node and all of its descencants will be marked as having a
              changed ancestry and appended to the list of touched nodes --
              see `ancestry_changed'.
         [>>] If a node's data is changed by `jpx_metanode::change_to_label',
              `jpx_metanode::change_to_delayed', etc., the node will be
              appended to the list of touched nodes and all of its
              descendants will be marked as having a changed ancestry and
              also appended -- see `is_changed'.
         [>>] If any of the node's immediate descendants is deleted or moved
              to a different parent so that it is no longer reachable via
              that descendant's `get_parent' function -- see `child_removed'.
         [>>] If `jpx_metanode::touch' is invoked, the node and all of its
              descedants will be appended to the list of touched nodes.
         [//]
         Noting that all of the above conditions also cause a node's descendants
         to be recursively appended to the list, we are able to guarantee that
         any node which experiences any of these conditions will always appear
         on the touched list prior to the point at which its descendants, if any,
         appear on the list.  This can simplify some applications of the function.
         [//]
         The following two conditions can also result in a node appearing on the
         touched list.  These conditions do not relate to changes in the state of
         the node itself, but rather changes in the ability to recover descendants
         of the node.  If a node appears on the touched list for one of these
         reasons and no other reason, it is possible that its descendants appear
         at an earlier location within the touched list -- it is not expected that
         this should complicate applications of the function.  The two conditions
         given below are relevant only in the case where the ultimate source of
         data is a dynamic cache, whose contents may grow in unexpected ways.
         [>>] If the number of descendants associated with a node becomes known
              where it was not known before (see `jpx_metanode::count_descendants')
              the node will appear somewhere in the internal list of touched nodes;
              it is only guaranteed to appear prior to its descendants if it has
              also changed in one of the ways described above, or recently become
              available for the first time.
         [>>] If any immediate descendant of a node becomes available via
              `jpx_metanode::get_descendant' where it was not previously available,
              the node will appear somewhere in the internal list of touched nodes;
              it is only guaranteed to appear prior to its descendants if it has
              also changed in one of the ways described above, or recently
              become available for the first time.
         [//]
         This function is provided to facilitate efficient updating of
         application-defined structures as metadata becomes available
         (e.g., from a dynamic cache) or as metadata is edited.
         [//]
         To find out what changes actually occurred, you can use the
         functions `jpx_metanode::is_changed', `jpx_metanode::is_deleted'
         and `jpx_metanode::ancestor_changed'.  All of these functions may
         return false if the node is newly parsed from a data source or
         otherwise created, or if the node found its way onto the touched
         node list as a result of a call to `jpx_metanode::touch'.
         [//]
         One feature of this function is that metanodes which are freshly
         created as a result of parsing an input file are not considered to
         be touched until their principle box has been completely parsed
         (this is the first sub-box of an association box, or else it is
         the sole box associated with the metanode).  This means that every
         metanode you find on the touched list is available in full, except
         that its descendants, if any, might not yet all be available.  Once
         they become available, they too will be added to the touched list.

           remove them immediately so that the next call to the function can
           execute more efficiently.
         [ARG: num_box_types]
           Number of box types that are of interest to the caller.  If 0,
           the function clears all nodes from the internal touched list and
           returns an empty interface.
         [ARG: box_types]
           Array with `num_box_types' entries, identifying box types of
           interest to the caller.
         [ARG: last_peeked]
           If non-empty, the function treats this metanode as the result
           of a previous call to `peek_touched_nodes' or
           `peek_and_clear_touched_nodes' and starts scanning
           from the next metanode in the list of touched nodes.  If the
           `last_peeked' box does not belong to the touched nodes list, the
           function returns an empty interface.

           Use this function to copy the structure and contents of an
           entire metadata tree into the present object's metadata tree.
           This operation can be used to copy a source file's metadata
           tree to a new output file, possibly after some editing.  Note
           that this function uses `jpx_metanode::add_copy' so the conditions

           to keep any ultimate `jp2_family_src' object associated with `src'
           open until after the current metadata tree has been written using
           `jpx_target::write_metadata'.
           [//]
           One side effect of this function is that it also updates the
           `src' object to include as much metadata as can possibly be
           parsed from its ultimate data source.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           It is good practice to call this function prior to
           `jpx_metanode::add_copy' if you are planning to supply a true
           value for that function's `link_to_internal_copies' argument --
           note that this is not the default.
           [//]
           The function erases all internal records of copies which have been
           made to the `src' object and (if `recursive' is true) to all of
           its descendants.  You invoke the function on the `src' node/s
           that you intend to copy, from the `jpx_meta_manager' into which
           you intend to make the copy.  The internal copy locators kept by
           the target `jpx_meta_manager' are used to resolve links within
           the source of the copy to point to copies of original link target
           where possible -- this behaviour is automatic when copying between
           different metadata managers, but requires `add_copy' to be given
           `link_to_internal_copies'=true when copying within a single
           metadata manager.  The first time you make such a copy there
           is no need to call the present function.  However, if you make a
           second copy between the same pair of metadata managers (or a
           second copy within the same metadata manager), this function should
           be invoked first to ensure that links resolve to the correct
           copy generation.
           [//]
           It is usually simplest and safest to invoke this function with
           `src' set to the root of the source metadata hierarchy and
           `recursive' set to true.
         [ARG: recursive]
           If true, the function recursively passes through all descendants
           of the `src' node.
         [ARG: fixup_unresolved_links]
           If true, the function examines unresolved links which were left
           over from a previous copy process.  Unresolved links are copied
           link nodes (nodes for which `jpx_metanode::get_link' returns
           a non-empty interface) which were generated by
           `jpx_metanode::add_copy' with `link_to_internal_copies'=true,
           but for which no copy of the original link target has yet been
           encountered.  If `fixup_unresolved_links' is true and an
           unresolved link is discovered, the link is set to point back to
           the original target of the copy operation -- of course, this is
           not done if `src' belongs to a different metadata manager to the
           copied link which needs resolving, since links cannot point
           into the metadata hierarchy of a separate JPX source/target.  This
           fixup procedure is a very convenient way to conclude any large
           scale copying operation within a complex metadata graph.

      load_matches(int num_codestreams, const int codestream_indices[],
                   int num_compositing_layers, const int layer_indices[]);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function is provided to facilitate interaction with
           data sources that are ultimately fueled by a dynamic cache, whose
           contents may evolve over time.  The purpose of the function is
           to make sure that as many relevant metadata boxes have been parsed
           as possible prior to using `enumerate_matches' to retrieve nodes
           that match a particular set of critera.
           [//]
           Ignoring the function's four arguments for the moment, the
           basic objective of the function is to discover and parse any
           metadata boxes for which new data is available, since the last
           attempt was made to parse them.
           [//]
           The purpose of the function's four arguments is to provide you
           with a means of limiting the set of metadata boxes that the
           function actually attempts to parse.  The idea is that if you
           know you are only interested in metadata that is associated with
           a specific set of codestreams and/or compositing layers, then
           there is no need to attempt to parse boxes that lie within the
           span of a number list node, whose identified image entities do
           not match this set of codestreams/layers.  Similarly, there is
           no need to parse metadata that might be found within a
           compositing layer header box or a codestream header box that is
           not of interest.  In files with a very large number of
           compositing layers and/or codestreams, this might represent a large
           amount of metadata that does not have to be explored.
           [//]
           More specifically, if a number list node's descendants can be
           ignored if it identifies only codestreams that are not specified
           via the `num_codestreams' and `codestream_indices' arguments and
           compositing layers that are not specified via the
           `num_compositing_layers' and `layer_indices' arguments.  If
           `num_codestreams' is -ve, the caller is deemed to be interested in
           all codestreams; similarly, if `num_compositing_layers' is -ve,
           the caller is deemed to be interested in all compositing layers.
           [//]
           Considering that testing for matches against codestreams and
           compositing layers can be costly, these tests are only applied to
           incomplete top-level metadata nodes before attempting to parse
           their descendants to completion.  Top-level metadata nodes include
           those created to represent any metadata found within compositing
           layer header boxes and codestream header boxes.
           [//]
           It is not necessary to call this function if you intend to walk
           through the boxes using `jpx_metanode::get_next_descendant' or
           `jpx_metanode::get_prev_descendant', since those functions
           automatically attempt to parse boxes that have not yet been parsed.
           For a more comprehensive summary of the functions that parse
           relevant metadata on demand, see the introductory comments to
           `jpx_metanode'.
         [RETURNS]
           True if, as a result of calling this function, one or more
           new metadata nodes have become available.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function is the key metadata search facility offered by the
           `jpx_meta_manager' object.  It exploits the lists mentioned in
           the `jpx_meta_manager' overview discussion to avoid scanning
           through the entire metadata tree.

           If `last_node' is an empty interface, the function searches for
           the first node which matches the conditions established
           by the remaining arguments.
           [//]
           If `last_node' is not an empty interface, the function searches
           for the first node which follows the `last_node' and satisfies
           the conditions.  For reliable behaviour, any non-empty `last_node'
           interface should refer to a node which itself matches the
           conditions.
           [//]
           You should be aware that the order in which this function
           enumerates the matching nodes is not generally predictable.
           In fact, the order may potentially change each time you invoke
           the `load_matches' function.  In particular, if the file is located
           on a remote server, delivered via JPIP, you may need to call
           `load_matches' frequently, and after each call the only way
           to enumerate all metadata which matches some criterion is to
           start from scratch, calling this function first with an empty
           `last_node' interface and then until it returns an empty
           interface.
           [//]
           To understand the constraints imposed by the various arguments
           it is convenient to define three types of nodes:
             [>>] "ROI Nodes" are those whose `jpx_metanode::get_num_regions'
                  function returns non-zero.
             [>>] "Numlist Nodes" are those whose
                  `jpx_metanode::get_numlist_info' function returns true.
             [>>] "Unassociated Nodes" are those which do not satisfy
                  either of the criteria above AND are not descended from
                  any node which belongs to any of these categories -- in other
                  words, "Unassociated Nodes" are top-level nodes that are
                  neither "Numlist Nodes" nor "ROI Nodes", where "top-level"
                  is judged after flattening away any internal structuring
                  boxes that are hidden from the application level.
           [//]
           The function matches only those nodes which belong to one of
           the above three categories.  It matches "ROI Nodes" if and only
           if `region' is a non-empty region.  It matches "Numlist Nodes"
           if and only if `region' is an empty region and either
           `codestream_idx'>=0, `compositing_layer_idx'>=0 or
           `applies_to_rendered_result'=true.  It matches "Unassociated Nodes"
           if and only if `codestream_idx'=-1, `compositing_layer_idx'=-1,
           `applies_to_rendered_result'=false, and `region' is an empty
           region.
           [//]
           In many cases, the application may be interested in finding
           "Numlist Nodes" which contain metadata associated with the
           entities in the number list, but not with a specific ROI.  To
           facilitate this, the `exclude_region_numlists' argument may be
           set to true (see below).  This may be a lot faster for some files,
           especially those which contain a lot of numlist nodes whose
           purpose is only to provide codestream/compositing layer
           associations for ROI nodes.
           [//]
           In some files, numlist nodes might be duplicated in many places
           to provide associations for various parts of the metadata
           graph.  This can result in the function visiting many different
           identical numlist nodes, slowing down an application which is
           looking for a particular set of codestream or compositing layer
           indices (or trying to rank different sets of indices).  To
           speed things up, you may find the `exclude_duplicate_numlists'
           argument to be very useful.  When set to true, the function only
           visits the "first" in each set of identical numlist nodes, but
           you can later discover the rest by invoking the
           `jpx_metanode::find_next_identical_numlist' and
           `jpx_metanode::find_first_identical_numlist' functions.
         [RETURNS]
           An empty interface if no match can be found.
         [ARG: codestream_idx]
           If non-negative, the function matches "Numlist Nodes" which
           reference the indicated codestream index or
           "ROI Nodes" which have a "Numlist Node" in their ancestry which
           references the indicated codestream index.  The latter case
           applies only if `region' is non-empty.
         [ARG: compositing_layer_idx]
           If non-negative, the function matches "Numlist Nodes" which
           reference the indicated compositing layer index or
           "ROI Nodes" which have a "Numlist Node" in their ancestry that
           is compatible with the compositing layer index.  The latter case
           applies only if `region' is non-empty.
         [ARG: applies_to_rendered_result]
           If true, the function matches "Numlist Nodes" which
           reference the "rendered result" or "ROI Nodes" which have a
           "Numlist Node" in their ancestry which references the "rendered
           result".  The latter case applies only if `region' is non-empty.
         [ARG: region]
           If non-empty, the function matches only "ROI Nodes" whose
           bounding box intersects with the supplied region.  Note that this
           does not necessarily mean that any of the individual regions in
           the ROI description box will intersect with `region', although
           it usually does mean this.  See `jpx_metanode::get_bounding_box'
           for more on the bounding box.
         [ARG: min_size]
           Ignored unless `region' is a non-empty region.  In this case,
           the function matches only "ROI Nodes" which contain at least
           one region, whose width is no smaller than `min_size', as measured
           by `jpx_roi::measure_span'.  As discussed in connection with that
           function, the width of simple rectangles and ellipses is simply
           the smaller of their two dimensions, while the width of general
           quadrilaterals is measured as the width of the narrowest rectangle
           which encloses the quadrilateral and is aligned with at least
           one side parallel to one of the quadrilateral edges.
           [//]
           This argument facilitates the efficient deployment of
           resolution sensitive metadata browsing systems.  An interactive
           image browser, for example, may choose not to generate overlay
           information for spatially-sensitive metadata whose spatial
           dimensions are too small to be clearly discerned at the current
           viewing resolution.  For example, streets might only become
           apparent on an image of a metropolitan area at some sufficiently
           fine level of image detail.  Cluttering the image with metadata
           holding the street names before the streets can be clearly
           discerned would be inadvisable (and computationally inefficient).
         [ARG: exclude_region_numlists]
           If true, the function will skip over any "Numlist Nodes" whose
           only immediate descendants are "ROI Nodes".  The argument is
           relevant only if `region' is empty and either
           `codestream_idx' >= 0, `compositing_layer_idx' >= 0 or
           `applies_to_rendered_result' is true.
         [ARG: ignore_missing_numlist_categories]
           If false, all of the conditions associated with any non-negative
           `codestream_idx', `compositing_layer_idx' arguments must be true.
           Otherwise, it is sufficient to match numlists which satisfy any
           one of the conditions if no information is provided for the other.
           That is, it is sufficient to find a numlist which matches
           `codestream_idx' if it specifies no compositing layer indices;
           similarly, it is sufficient to find a numlist which matches
           `compositing_layer_idx' if it specifies no codestream indices.
         [ARG: exclude_duplicate_numlists]
           This argument is ignored unless `region' is empty and at least
           one of `codestream_idx' or `compositing_layer_idx' is non-negative
           or `applies_to_rendered_result' is true -- i.e., unless the function
           is being used to enumerate "Numlist nodes".  In this case, if this
           argument is true, the function returns only the initial matching
           numlist node, from each set of identical numlists.  Identical
           numlists have identical codestream indices, compositing layer
           indices and rendered result flags, but may have different
           descendants and different ancestors within the metadata
           hierarchy.  You may find that this saves a lot of time if you
           want to rank numlists based on additional criteria to those which
           can be passed across this interface.  You can always find the
           other matching numlists with the aid of the navigation functions,
           `jpx_metanode::find_next_identical_numlist' and
           `jpx_metanode::find_first_identical_numlist'.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function provides an especially convenient mechanism for
           creating new metadata nodes.  Although it is possible to create
           the nodes directly using functions such as
           `jpx_metanode::add_numlist' and `jpx_metanode::add_regions',
           multiple function calls may be needed to determine whether an
           appropriate association context has already been created.
           [//]
           The present function does all the work for you.  It analyzes the
           metadata sub-tree descended from `root' (or the global root of
           the metadata tree if `root' is empty) to see if it already contains
           a node that is associated with exactly the same set of
           image entities (codestreams, compositing layers or the rendered
           result).  If so, the function returns a reference to that node or,
           if `num_regions' > 0, it returns a reference to a newly created
           ROI description node which is added as a descendant to that
           node.
           [//]
           If necessary, the function creates new entries in the metadata
           tree to hold a number list, representing the image entities
           specified via the first five arguments.
           [//]
           If `num_regions' is 0, the returned node lies in a context which
           does not associated it with any image region.  In this case, the
           returned node may be one which already existed within the
           sub-tree anchored at `root' (of the global metadata root if
           `root' was empty).  If `num_regions' is non-zero, the function
           always creates a new ROI description node, even if an identical
           one already exists with the same image entity associations.  This
           saves us the overhead of tracking down unlikely events.
           [//]
           If `num_codestreams' and `num_compositing_layers' are 0 and
           `applies_to_rendered_result' is false, the function returns a
           reference to a node which is not associated with any specific
           imagery. This is likely to be the root of the metadata
           tree, or `root' if it was not empty, but we might return
           something different in the future.  The only exception to this
           is if `container_id' > 0, as discussed below.
           [//]
           If `container_id' >= 0, the behaviour of the function is best
           understood by considering the following two cases:
           [>>] If `root' is an empty interface or the root of the metadata
                hierarchy, a top-level node is created (if necessary) that
                has the container embedding property (same as invoking
                `jpx_metanode::add_numlist' on the root of the metadata
                hierarchy) -- as with that function, if `container_id'
                does not correspond to an existent JPX container, an error
                is generated through `kdu_error'.
           [>>] Otherwise, `container_id' must be identical to the value
                returned by `root.get_container_id'; otherwise an error
                will be generated through `kdu_error'.
           [//]
           Note that in the event that `root.container_id' returns
           non-negative, the relevant node will be embedded in the
           associated JPX container regardless of whether the `container_id'
           argument is -ve or not, but supplying a non-negative value for
           `container_id' may be useful as a consistency check -- causing
           an error message to be generated if incompatibility is detected.
           [//]
           In any of the circumstances described above, if the node is to
           be embedded within a JPX container, all supplied codestream and
           compositing layer indices must be compatible with the relevant
           container.  Compatibility means that all such indices correspond
           to codestream or compositing layers (as appropriate) that are
           defined either at the top level of the file, or by the container
           itself.  As with `jpx_metanode::add_numlist', indices corresponding
           to codestreams or compositing layers that are defined by the JPX
           container are NOT REQUIRED to match the container's base
           codestreams or compositing layers, but they are automatically
           converted to base indices.  Any violation of these compatibility
           requirements results in the generation of an error message through
           `kdu_error'.
           [//]
           RECOMMENDATIONS for JPIP ACCESSIBLITY:
           It is good to be aware of the implications of a metadata
           structure on what a JPIP client might efficiently discover
           when browsing a remote file.  Here are some recommendations:
           [>>] If you are adding a node that you wish to be visible
                to a JPIP client even if it is not currently browsing
                any of the referenced imagery, you should either make it
                a top-level node (`root' empty and `container_id' -ve) or,
                preferably, you should make it a descendant of a label, XML
                or other non-imagery metanode that is itself found either
                at the top level of the metadata hierarchy or as an
                immediate descendant of an "container" number list.  A
                "container" number list is a number list added using this
                function or `add_numlist' that has a non-negative
                `container_id' value but is otherwise empty (no codestreams,
                compositing layers or rendered result).  Container number
                lists are just a vehicle for recording metadata that should
                be embedded within a JPX container.  Any node other than a
                number list that is embedded as an immediate descendant
                of a JPX container is semantically equivalent to a top-level
                metanode and should be treated as such by a JPIP server.
           [>>] What the above guideline means is that you should be careful
                of invoking this function with `root' empty and
                `container_id' non-negative.  This adds top-level number
                lists to be embedded within a JPX container, which is fine,
                but a JPIP server may only deliver such metanodes when
                asked explicitly or when the window of interest sent to
                the server includes one of the referenced codestreams or
                compositing layers.  This might not be appropriate if the
                number list is intended to represent and describe a very
                large collection of imagery whose existence you wish to
                expose to clients under all conditions.
         [ARG: num_codestreams]
           Number of codestreams with which the returned node must be
           associated.  It should be associated with no more and no
           fewer.
         [ARG: codestream_indices]
           Array with `num_codestreams' entries containing the indices
           of the codestreams with which the returned node must be
           associated.  All indices start from 0, which represents the
           first codestream in the file.
         [ARG: num_compositing_layers]
           Number of compositing layers with which the returned node must be
           associated.  It should be associated with no more and no
           fewer.
         [ARG: layer_indices]
           Array with `num_compositing_layers' entries containing the indices
           of the compositing layers with which the returned node must be
           associated.  All indices start from 0, which represents the
           first compositing layer in the file.
         [ARG: applies_to_rendered_result]
           True if the returned node is to be associated with the "rendered
           result"; otherwise it is not to be associated with the rendered
           result.  The meaning of association with the "rendered result" is
           not entirely clear from the JPX standard, since there could
           potentially be multiple rendered results (e.g., if the composition
           box describes an animation).
         [ARG: num_regions]
           Number of elements in the `regions' array.  If this is non-zero,
           the `num_codestreams' argument must also be non-zero, since 
           the contents of an ROI description box are meaningful primarily
           when its regions are associated with some code-stream.  In the
           future, we may remove this restriction, since the JPX file format
           does allow for the possibility of unassociated ROI description
           boxes, which are interpreted as belonging to the rendered result.
           For the purpose of creating JPX metadata from scratch, however,
           it is unlikely that any flexibility is sacrificed by forcing the
           application to describe regions with respect to a codestream
           coordinate system.
           [//]
           If this argument is zero, the returned node is not to be
           associated with any image regions through ROI description boxes.
         [ARG: regions]
           Array with `num_regions' entries, holding the collection of
           image regions which are to be recorded in an ROI description
           box with which the returned node is to be associated.
         [ARG: root]
           If this is an empty interface (the default), the function
           effectively makes `root' equal to the global root of the metadata
           tree -- i.e., the node returned by `access_root'.
         [ARG: container_id]
           You may specify a non-negative value here to ensure that any
           returned node is embedded within the corresponding JPX container;
           if this is not possible, an error will be generated through
           `kdu_error', as explained above.
           [//]
           In the specific case where `container_id' >= 0 and the `root'
           interface is empty or equal to the root of the metadata
           hierarchy (as given by `jpx_meta_manager::access_root'), if
           `num_codestreams', `num_compositing_layers' and
           `applies_to_rendered_result' are all 0/false, the function
           inserts (or finds) a special numlist node that has no associations
           at all, except that it serves to ensure that all of its
           descendants are embedded within the relevant JPX container.
           See `jpx_metanode::get_numlist_info' for more information on
           what it means for metadata nodes to be embedded within a JPX
           container.
           [//]
           In many cases, the `container_id' value will be obtained by
           first recovering a `jpx_container_source' interface using
           `jpx_source::find_unique_compatible_container', followed by
           a call to `jpx_container_source::get_container_id'.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function is able to open both JP2 and JPX compatible data
           sources.  Note that the most correct suffix to use for JPX files
           is actually ".jpf", not ".jpx", although the latter is not an
           unreasonable choice.  If the data source is not compatible with
           either the JPX or JP2 specifications, an error will be generated
           through `kdu_error', unless `return_if_incompatible' is true.
           [//]
           It is illegal to invoke this function on an object which has
           previously been opened, but not yet closed.
         [RETURNS]
           Three possible values, as follows:
           [>>] 0 if insufficient information is available from the `src'
                object to complete the opening operation.  In practice,
                this can occur only if the `src' object is fueled by a
                dynamic cache (a `kdu_cache' object).  In order to complete
                the opening of a JP2 data source, the signature and file-type
                boxes must both be found.  In order to complete the opening
                of a JPX file, the reader requirements box must also be
                found or else it must be discovered to be missing (some
                earlier JPX writers did not generate the JPX box, even though
                it is formally required), but we can tell if it is missing
                pretty easily, since it is required to follow the file-type
                box.
           [>>] 1 if successful.
           [>>] -1 if the data source is found not to be compatible with the
                JPX or JP2 specifications on the basis of the signature or
                file-type boxes (or their absence).  This value will not
                be returned unless `return_if_incompatible' is true (see
                below).  If it is returned, the object will be left in the
                closed state.
         [ARG: src]
           The `jp2_family_src' object must already have been opened.  It
           should generally support seeking, since non-seekable sources will
           cause errors to be generated unless the `jpx_source' is used
           in a manner which is consistent with linearly reading the
           data sources from beginning to end -- such use is possible for
           appropriately organized files.
           [//]
           NOTE CAREFULLY: if your application needs to perform multi-threaded
           decompression while simultaneously using the services offered by
           the present object to dynamically load metadata or structural
           information from `src' -- this would definitely happen, for
           example, in interactive applications where the ultimate source
           of data is a dynamic cache (see `kdu_cache') -- then you need
           to make sure that the `src->acquire_lock' and
           `src->release_lock' functions actually do provide mutually
           exclusive locking functionality.  That is, you need to provide a
           derived version of `jp2_family_src' here, which implements those
           functions.  The `jp2_threadsafe_family_src' class should fit the
           bill.
         [ARG: return_if_incompatible]
           If false, an error will be generated through `kdu_error' if the
           data source is found to be incompatible with either the JPX or JP2
           specifications.  If true, incompatibility will not generate an
           error, but the function will return -1, leaving the application
           free to pass the `src' object to another file format reader
           (unless the `src' is not seekable, in which case it must be closed
           and re-opened before trying a different file format reader).

    KDU_AUX_EXPORT bool count_codestreams(int &count);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           If the number of codestreams in the JPX/JP2 data source is already
           known, this function returns true, writing that number into `count'.
           Otherwise, the function attempts to parse further into the data
           source in order to count the number of codestreams which are
           available.  If it encounters the end of the source, or is otherwise
           able to deduce that the number of codestreams is known, it again
           returns true, writing the number of codestreams into `count'.
           [//]
           If the function is unable to parse to a point at which the number
           of codestreams can be known, it returns false, writing the
           number of codestreams encountered up to that point into the
           `count' argument.
           [//]
           A codestream is considered to have been encountered once any of
           the following happens:
           [>>] Its codestream header box is encountered at the top level of
                the file or is determined to belong to one of the repetition
                instances of a JPX container (JPLX box).
           [>>] Its contiguous codestream (JP2C) or fragment table (FTBL) box
                is found at the top-level of the file or within a Multiple
                Codestream (J2CX) box.
           [>>] The existence of the codestream is identified via the
                Multiple Codestream Info (J2CI) box that appears as the first
                sub-box of a Multiple Codestream (J2CX) box.
           [//]
           To actually access the codestream via the `access_codestream'
           function, more information is generally required.  Depending on
           how that function is invoked, the codestream's main header might
           need to be available.  Moreover, either its codestream header box
           must have been encountered, or the reader must be able to deduce
           that there will be no codestream header boxes in the file
           (normally, this can only be deduced once the end of the file has
           been encountered, so JPX writers are strongly advised to include
           codestream header boxes).  However, these conditions need not all
           be met for the codestream's existence to be determined by the
           present function.
         [RETURNS]
           False if it is possible that more codestreams remain in the
           data source, but the function is unable to parse any further
           into the source at this point.  This generally means that the
           underlying `jp2_family_src' object is fueled by a dynamic cache
           (i.e., a `kdu_cache' object).
           [//]
           To be sure of eventually discovering codestreams that exist
           in the original source, consider using `generate_metareq' to
           augment client window requests that you send to a JPIP server.
      */
    KDU_AUX_EXPORT bool count_compositing_layers(int &count);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function plays a similar role to `count_codestreams' but
           counts the number of compositing layers instead.  If the data
           source contains compositing layer header (JPLH) boxes,
           the function counts the number of such boxes.  If it contains
           JPX containers (JPLX boxes), the embedded JPLH boxes and their
           explicit or implicit repetitions are also counted.
           [//]
           The function returns true, unless it cannot be sure what the count
           is, because insufficient elements from the data source are
           currently available.  This generally means that the underlying
           `jp2_family_src' object is fueled by a dynamic cache
           (i.e., a `kdu_cache' object).
           [//]
           When the number of compositing layers cannot yet be determined,
           the function writes the number of compositing layers that it
           currently knows about into the `count' argument.  This may be 0
           if the data source contains no compositing layer header boxes and
           the end of the source has not yet been encountered.
           [//]
           JPX data sources need not necessarily contain compositing layer
           header boxes; in this case, each codestream represents a separate
           compositing layer.  However, the reader cannot make this judgement
           until the end of the file has been encountered.  If the data
           source is ultimately fueled by a dynamic cache whose top-level
           databin is incomplete, the function may thus have to return with
           `count' equal to 0, even if a large number of codestreams have
           been encountered already.  For these reasons, JPX writers are
           strongly encouraged to include compositing layer header boxes,
           even if they are not strictly required.

           This function plays a similar role to `count_codestreams' but
           counts the number of JPX containers (Compositing Layer Extensions
           boxes) instead.  Containers play an important role in efficiently
           capturing long or complex animations -- e.g., hyperspectral
           video with multiple presentation tracks offering different ways
           to visualize the content.

           role played by containers -- note, however, that most applications
           can reap the benefits of containers without needing to be
           explicitly aware of their existence.
           [//]
           When the number of JPX containers cannot yet be determined,
           the function writes the number of containers that it

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Provides access to the codestream identified by `which'.  If
           `which' is 0, this is the first codestream in the data source; if
           `which' is 1, it is the second codestream in the data source, and
           so forth.
           [//]
           If the function is unable to access the relevant codestream
           information at present, it returns an empty interface (one whose
           `jpx_codestream_source::exists' function returns false).  This may
           happen either because the total number of codestreams in the
           data source is less than or equal to `which', or because the
           function is not yet able to parse far enough into the data source
           to recover the relevant boxes along with the code-stream's main
           header (if `need_main_header' is true).  The latter conditions
           can occur only if the underlying `jp2_family_src' objct is fueled
           by a dynamic cache (i.e., a `kdu_cache' object).

           To be sure of eventually discovering codestreams that exist
           in the original source, consider using `generate_metareq' to
           augment client window requests that you send to a JPIP server.
           [//]
           Before this function will return a non-empty interface, it must
           have encountered the contiguous codestream (jp2c) or fragment
           table (ftbl) box which holds the codestream's contents, or else
           it must have encountered a multiple codestream (j2cx) box from
           which the presence of the contiguous codestream or fragment
           table box can be deduced.
           [//]
           For data sources which are fueled by a dynamic cache, the entire
           main header must also be available already, unless
           `need_main_header' is false, in which case the
           `jpx_codestream_source::stream_ready' interface can be used to
           determine the point at which the main header is available.  If
           the codestream is represented by a fragment table box, however,
           it is not possible to check for main header availability, so the
           `need_main_header' argument is ignored.  The object must also
           have either seen all top level box headers in the data source,
           or have encountered both the JP2 header (jp2h) box
           and the relevant codestream header (chdr) box.
           [//]
           The above conditions are more stringent than those required to
           count codestreams, so that `which' may be much less than the number
           returned by `count_codestreams', yet this function still returns
           an empty interface.  This just means that the underlying dynamic
           cache must receive more data before the codestream can be
           accessed.  In fact, it is possible that this function succeeds
           when invoked with one value for `which' but fails when invoked
           with a smaller value for `which', because a dynamic cache
           might have information for one codestream even while it is waiting
           to receive information for an earlier one.
         [ARG: need_main_header]
           If true, the `kdu_codestream_source::stream_ready' function
           of any non-empty returned interface will always return true.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Similar to `access_codestream' but accesses the information
           associated with the compositing layer identified by `which'.  If
           `which' is 0, this is the first compositing layer in the data
           source; if `which' is 1, the second compositing layer is being
           requested, and so forth.  All data sources managed by this object
           are deemed to have at least one compositing layer, even if they
           do not contain explicit compositing layer header boxes.  Even a
           basic JP2 file always has one compositing layer and one codestream.
           If the data source contains compositing layer header boxes, there
           is one compositing layer for each such header box.  Otherwise
           (and this can only be determined by parsing to the end of the
           file first), each codestream corresponds to a separate implicit
           compositing layer.

           it returns an empty interface (one whose `jpx_layer_source::exists'

           total number of compositing layers in the data source is less than
           or equal to `which', or because the function is not yet able to
           parse far enough into the data source to recover the relevant
           boxes.  The latter generally occurs only if the underlying
           `jp2_family_src' object is fueled by a dynamic cache (i.e., a
           `kdu_cache' object).

           augment client window requests that you send to a JPIP server.
           [//]
           Before the function will return a non-empty interface, it must
           have found and parsed the relevant compositing layer header (JPLH)
           box, if any, in addition to any JP2 header (jp2h) box which is
           required for recovering default parameters, and any codestream
           header box whose component mapping box might be required to
           interpret channel mapping rules.  Alternatively, we must have
           reached the end of the data source or have other means of knowing
           that there will be no compositing layer header box for this layer.
           These complexities arise because JPX was created to allow quite
           a bit of flexibility for writers, but this has obvious adverse
           implications for readers, leaving them unable to make solid
           incremental decisions often until all boxes have been seen.  The
           Kakadu implementation does its best to hide all such irregularities
           from the application.
           [//]
           For sources with a very large number of compositing layers, the
           introduction of JPX containers (Compositing Layer Extensions boxes)
           with KDU-7.2 can allow readers to figure out what is going on in
           a complex JPX file much more quickly, since they greatly reduce the
           number of top-level boxes that must appear within the file.
           [//]
           Before the function will return a non-empty interface, each of
           the associated codestreams must also be sufficiently available,

           non-empty interface when invoked with each of their identifiers.

     [SYNOPSIS]
       Provides full support for generating or copying JPX files.
       Note that the most correct suffix to use for JPX files is actually
       ".jpf", not ".jpx", although the latter is still a reasonable choice. 
       The typical sequence of operations used to generate a JPX file is
       as follows:
       [>>] Create and open a `jp2_family_tgt' object.
       [>>] Pass this object to `jpx_target::open'.
       [>>] Add at least one codestream using `jpx_target::add_codestream' and
            at least one composition layer using `jpx_target::add_layer'.
       [>>] Configure the various parameters of the `jpx_codestream_target'
            and `jpx_layer_target' interfaces returned via the above-mentioned
            functions.
       [>>] Call `write_headers' to write the JPX file header and as many
            of the compositing layer and codestream header boxes as you
            like.  If you have installed breakpoints using
            `jpx_codestream_target::set_breakpoint'
            or `jpx_layer_target::set_breakpoint', you must call
            `write_headers' multiple times, writing additional boxes of your
            choice after each breakpoint.
       [>>] Optionally write additional boxes after `write_headers' returns
            NULL.
       [>>] Pass through each `jpx_codestream_target' interface in turn,
            using its `jpx_codestream_target::open_stream' function to open a
            contiguous codestream box.  Pass this box directly to 
            `kdu_codestream::create' and generate the codestream using
            `kdu_codestream::flush'.  Alternatively, you may write directly to
            the open box (e.g., to copy a code-stream, or write a non-JPEG2000
            codestream).  As a final alternative, you may use
            `jpx_codestream_target::write_fragment_table' to write a fragment
            table box in place of a contiguous codestream box.
       [>>] If you have used the `codestream_threshold' feature of the
            `write_headers' function you may need to invoke it again
            periodically, so as to interleave codestream header boxes and/or
            compositing layer header boxes with the codestreams (or
            fragment tables) themselves.
       [>>] Optionally write additional boxes after generating each
            codestream.
       [>>] Call `close' to finish the JPX file (it may or may not write
            additional boxes) and clean up internal resources.
       [>>] Call `jp2_family_tgt::close' when you are completely finished.
       [//]
       Note that this object will make every effort to produce JPX files
       which are also JP2 compatible, recording the outcome of the
       relevant compatibility tests in the file-type box.  For this reason,
       an application may choose to always write JPX files, even if the
       JP2 feature set is sufficient for its purposes.

           Use this function to create one or more containers, each of
           which may hold its own set of `jpx_codestream_target' and
           `jpx_layer_target' objects, along with its own set of
           compositing instructions for one or more presentation tracks.
           [//]
           Containers were introduced with Ammendment 3 of IS15444-2.  One
           feature of containers is that they can very efficiently describe
           simple repeating patterns of compositing layers and codestreams.
           Specifically, the container describes a total of
           R*Cbase codestreams and R*Lbase compositing layers, where
           Cbase is the value of `num_base_codestreams', Lbase is the value
           of `num_base_layers', and R is the number of JPEG2000 contiguous
           codestream boxes or fragment table boxes that are written to
           each of the Cbase `jpx_codestream_target' objects that are
           subsequently obtained via `jpx_container_target::access_codestream'.
           [//]
           In the special case where Cbase is 0, the value of R must be
           given directly by the `repetition_factor' argument.  Otherwise,
           if this is the last container added to the file, it is allowed for
           `repetition_factor' to be 0, in which case R is discovered on the
           fly through the addition of contiguous codestreams or fragment
           tables (see `jpx_codestream_target::open_stream' and
           `jpx_codestream_target::write_fragment_table') to each of the
           base `jpx_codestream_target' objects.  However, at least one
           such contiguous codestream or fragment table box must be written
           so that R cannot be 0.
           [//]
           The container provides explicit descriptions only for the initial
           Cbase codestreams and Lase compositing layers; this metadata is
           implicitly adjusted to accommodate successive repetitions -- see
           `jpx_container_target' for more information on such adjustments.
           [//]
           You should be aware that this function may not be used unless
           you have already fully configured all top-level compositing layers
           and codestreams, as well as the top-level `jpx_composition'
           object recovered via `access_composition'.  Moreover, the function
           may not be used if you have already invoked `write_headers'
           or `write_metadata' without first adding at least one container
           or calling `expect_containers'.
           [//]
           You should also be aware of the fact that once this function has
           been invoked, you may not add further top-level compositing layers
           or codestreams via `add_layer' or `add_codestream'.
         [ARG: num_base_codestreams]
           Value of Cbase (see above) which defines the number of
           codestream header boxes that are actually embedded within the
           container when it is written to the file.  This value can be
           zero if all compositing layers defined by the container refer
           to top-level codestreams; however, in this case it is not
           allowed for the `repetition_factor' argument to be 0.
         [ARG: num_base_layers]
           Value of Lbase (see above) which defines the number of compositing
           layer header boxes that are actually embedded within the
           container when it is written to the file.  This value must be
           strictly greater than 0.
         [ARG: repetition_factor]
           Supplies either the fixed value of R (see above), or else must
           be 0.  In this latter, case, `num_base_codestreams' must be
           non-zero and R is determined by the number of contiguous
           codestreams or fragment tables that are written to each of the
           embedded Cbase `jpx_codestream_target' interfaces.  Moreover,
           in this case, the value of `num_base_codestreams' must be non-zero.
           [//]
           The reason for providing the option for `repetition_factor' to
           equal 0 is that it allows the container's metadata to be
           written in full to the file before the final number of actual
           codestreams (and hence repetitions) is known.  This is
           useful for generating files on the fly from live capture data.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function provides control over an advanced capability that
           is used in conjunction with calls to `add_container' to
           dramatically reduce the amount of top-level boxes written to
           the file when there are a very large number of codestreams; this
           feature also facilitates efficient random access to codestreams
           of interest.  The feature applies only to those codestreams
           whose codestream headers are contained within JPX containers
           (see `add_container'), since without containers, all codestreams
           must appear individually at the top-level of the file.  This
           function gives you control over how and whether this is done.
           [//]
           If `max_j2cx_streams' <= 1, all codestreams will be written to
           fragment tables or contiguous codestream boxes at the top level of
           the file, except in the event that some codestreams have already
           been written to J2CX boxes, in which case the function call has
           no effect.
           [//]
           Otherwise, if `max_j2cx_streams' > 1, non-top-level codestreams
           are written to J2CX boxes using the following algorithm:
           [>>] The first J2CX box is assigned space to accommodate
                C0 codestreams, where C0=max{2,`min_j2cx_streams'}.
           [>>] Each subsequent J2CX box (if required) is assigned space
                to accommodate twice as many codestreams as the previous one,
                up to a maximum of `max_j2cx_streams'.  However, if any
                codestream's size approaches or exceeds 4GB, or if any
                codestream is recorded as multiple application-supplied
                fragments (see `jpx_codestream_target::write_fragment_table'),
                the algorithm used to aggregate codestreams into J2CX boxes
                may need to be modified on the fly.
           [>>] Within J2CX boxes, codestreams are usually written indirectly
                through fragment tables, regardless of whether the application
                uses `jpx_codestream_target::open_stream' or
                `jpx_codestream_target::write_fragment_table'.  In the
                latter case, you are strongly advised to write fragment tables
                with exactly one fragment (facilitites random access).  In
                the former case, the codestream itself is actually written to
                a Media Data box located beyond the relevant J2CX box within
                the file; it is referenced through a fragment table with
                exactly one fragment, that is automatically generated.
                However, if you wind up writing fragment tables with a
                large number of fragments, or contiguous codestreams that
                are larger than 4GB, the internal machinery may cause a
                less regular, or slightly less readily accessible
                organization to be used.
           [>>] To facilitate efficient random access via JPIP, J2CX boxes
                may be written inside other J2CX boxes, so that each J2CX
                box's immediate descendants consist of the mandatory
                Multiple Codestream Info sub-box, followed either by a
                maximum of 16 fragment table boxes or a maximum of 16
                subordinate J2CX boxes, each of which conforms to the same
                structure.
           [//]
           If you do not call this function at all, the default setup
           employs `min_j2cx_streams'=2 and `max_j2cx_streams'=2^16.

           [//]
           If `codestream_threshold' < 0, all codestream header boxes
           and compositing layer header boxes will also be written at this
           point.  Otherwise, the function writes all codestream header
           boxes, up to and including the one corresponding to
           the codestream whose index is `codestream_threshold' (indices
           run from 0), and all compositing layer header boxes, up to
           and including the first one whose compositing layer uses the
           codestream whose index is `codestream_threshold'.  It may write
           more headers than you request, but only to the extent that this
           is unavoidable given other constraints -- especially constraints
           set up by the interaction between metadata that is to be embedded
           inside JPX containers and links (cross references) whose target
           write locations may need to be discovered to generate such
           metadata.
           [//]
           When used in this way, the function returns with a NULL
           pointer, once it has written this limited set of headers, leaving
           the application to call the function again, with a larger value of
           `codestream_threshold', once it is prepared to write later
           codestreams.  In this way, compositing layer and codestream
           header boxes, as well as JPX containers (Compositing Layer
           Extensions boxes), may be interleaved with the contiguous
           codestream or fragment table codestream boxes.
           [//]
           If you have installed a breakpoint using one of the functions
           `jpx_codestream_target::set_breakpoint' or
           `jpx_layer_target::set_breakpoint', the present function will
           return prematurely, with a pointer to the open super-box associated
           with the context in which the breakpoint was installed.  In this
           case, the function must be called again, until all breakpoints
           have been passed (i.e., until it returns NULL).
           [//]
           You should be aware that in complex situations, this function may
           also cause metadata added via the `jpx_meta_manager' interface to
           be written as well.  This is necessitated, for example, if
           such metadata is required to be embedded within JPX containers
           (Compositing Layer Extensions boxes) -- see
           `jpx_meta_manager::insert_node' and `jpx_metanode::add_numlist'
           for an explanation of this.  In these cases, it is possible that
           the function will also encounter metadata that has been added with
           the `jpx_metanode::add_delayed' function, which results in another
           type of application-defined breakpoint, causing the function to
           return a non-NULL pointer to an open `jp2_output_box' into which
           the contents of the relevant box should be written.  As with
           codestream and compositing layer breakpoints, mentioned above, the
           function needs to be called repeatedly until it eventually returns
           NULL.
           [//]
           If this function does return non-NULL, the value of
           `codestream_threshold' is recorded internally and
           used to override any supplied `codestream_threshold' argument in
           each successive call to this function until NULL is returned.
           This helps to emphasize the fact that the caller is expected to
           issue a sequence of calls to this function until it returns
           NULL, and the entire sequence is to be interpreted as
           accomplishing the originally intended action.  It is important
           that this sequence of calls is not interrupted by the addition
           of new imagery or metadata -- most of the time, attempting to do
           so will result in the generation of informative error messages
           through `kdu_error'.
         [RETURNS]
           NULL if the requested headers have been completely written.
           This does not necessarily mean that the function need not be
           called again.  Indeed, it may need to be called again if the
           number of codestreams to be written is greater than
           `codestream_threshold'+1.  As explained above, this allows
           codestream header boxes and compositing layer header boxes to
           be interleaved with the codestream data itself, or with
           fragment tables pointing to that data.
           [//]
           A non-NULL return means that a breakpoint has been encountered
           during the writing of an image header, or the function needed to
           write a metadata node that was added using
           `jpx_metanode::add_delayed' or an equivalent operation.
           [//]
           If the breakpoint belongs to an image header, you may write
           any additional sub-boxes of interest within the returned
           super-box.  If the breakpoint belongs to a delayed metadata node,
           you are required to write the box's contents only (as opposed to
           sub-boxes).
           [//]
           Note carefully that the function may return the same breakpoint
           twice, expecting you to write the relevant content in exactly the
           same way on both occasions.  The reason for this is that a first
           "simulation" pass may be required in some circumstances, in order
           to discover the lengths and locations of boxes that are the targets
           of link metanodes (cross reference boxes) that might need to be
           embedded within Compositing Layer Extensions boxes.
           [//]
           You should call the function repeatedly until it returns NULL,
           without adding new imagery or metadata in between such calls.
         [ARG: i_param]
           If non-NULL, the integer parameter passed as an argument to the
           relevant `jpx_codestream_target::set_breakpoint',
           `jpx_layer_target::set_breakpoint' or `jpx_metanode::add_delayed'
           function is returned in *`i_param'.
         [ARG: addr_param]
           If non-NULL, the address parameter passed as an argument to the
           relevant `jpx_codestream_target::set_breakpoint',
           `jpx_layer_target::set_breakpoint' or `jpx_metanode::add_delayed'

         [ARG: codestream_threshold]
           -ve or else index of the last codestream for which top-level
           header boxes need to be written.  If the identified codestream
           lies within a JPX container (see `add_container'), the
           top-level Compositing Layer Extensions box that holds its
           Codestream Header box is written in full.

    KDU_AUX_EXPORT jp2_output_box *
      write_metadata(int *i_param=NULL, void **addr_param=NULL);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Use this function to write the metadata managed via
           `jpx_meta_manager' (see `access_meta_manager') to the actual
           output file.
           [//]
           As with `write_headers', before calling this function for the
           first time, if you intend to add JPX containers, you should either
           have invoked `add_container' at least once or you should have
           invoked `expect_containers'.
           [//]
           Prior to KDU7.2, this function needed to be called at most once
           and only after `write_headers'.  However, from KDU7.2, metadata
           writing has been greatly enhanced, offering you the flexibility
           to add and write metadata incrementally.  You should be aware
           that in some cases, some of the metadata may be written indirectly
           via calls to `write_headers' -- relevant if you have added
           number lists with the JPX container embedding property.  Conversely,
           in some cases, calls to this function will also write image headers
           such as compositing layer headers, codestream headers and/or
           JPX containers (Compositing Layer Extensions boxes), but these
           happen only to the extent necessary.  You may call this function
           and `write_headers' as often as you like in any order.
           [//]
           The purpose of a call to this function is to write all outstanding
           metadata to the output file.  If you subsequently add new
           metadata (e.g., via calls to `jpx_meta_manager::insert_node') that
           data will be written in subsequent calls to this function (or
           possibly in calls to `write_headers', if that is unavoidable).
           You do have to be aware, however, that errors will be generated if
           you attempt to add descendants to metadata nodes that have already
           been written.  Also, if you attempt to add a link metanode (see
           `jpx_metanode::add_link' or `jpx_metanode::change_to_link') to
           metadata that has already been written, an error will be generated
           unless the target metanode was marked for state preservation
           via a call to `jpx_metanode::preserve_for_links' prior to being
           written.
           [//]
           The function may need to be called multiple times before the
           metadata is completely written.  Exactly like `write_headers'
           the function will return with a non-NULL pointer whenever it
           encounters a breakpoint.  A breakpoint is any `jpx_metanode'
           which was created using `jpx_metanode::add_delayed',
           changed using `jpx_metanode::change_to_delayed' or copied from
           such a metanode.  Since this function may need to write JPX
           containers within which metadata is to be embedded, it may also
           encounter breakpoints created using
           `jpx_codestream_target::add_breakpoint' or
           `jpx_layer_target::add_breakpoint'.  As with `write_headers',
           the application needs to be prepared to disambiguate all such
           breakpoint conditions based on the values returned via
           `i_param' and `addr_param', or the box type of the returned
           `jp2_output_box' reference.
         [RETURNS]
           NULL if all of the available metadata has been written.
           A non-NULL return means that a breakpoint has been encountered,
           associated with a node created using `jpx_metanode::add_delayed'
           or an equivalent, or the breakpoint may possibly be associated
           with image headers that needed to be written.  These cases may
           be distinguished by examining the box type of the returned
           `jp2_output_box' reference; in particular, if the breakpoint
           was created using `jpx_codestream_target::set_breakpoint' or
           `jpx_layer_target::set_breakpoint', the returned `jp2_output_box'
           object will have a box type of `jp2_codestream_header_4cc' or
           `jp2_compositing_layer_hdr_4cc'.  Alternatively, the breakpoint
           information returned via `i_param' and `addr_param' may be
           used to identify the breakpoint that has occurred.
           [//]
           If the breakpoint belongs to an image header, you may write
           any additional sub-boxes of interest within the returned
           super-box.  If the breakpoint belongs to a delayed metadata node,
           you are required to write the box's contents only (as opposed to
           sub-boxes).
           [//]
           Note carefully that the function may return the same breakpoint
           twice, expecting you to write the relevant content in exactly the
           same way on both occasions.  The reason for this is that a first
           pass through the metadata hierarchy may be required in order to
           discover the lengths and locations of boxes that are the targets
           of link metanodes (cross reference boxes).
           [//]
           In any event, you should call this function repeatedly until it
           returns NULL, without adding new imagery or metadata in between
           such calls.
         [ARG: i_param]
           If non-NULL, the integer parameter supplied to
           `jpx_metanode::add_delayed', or possibly to one of
           `jpx_codestream_target::set_breakpoint' or
           `jpx_layer_target::set_breakpoint' is written into *`i_param'.
         [ARG: addr_param]
           If non-NULL, the address parameter supplied to
           `jpx_metanode::add_delayed', or possibly to one of
           `jpx_codestream_target::set_breakpoint' or
