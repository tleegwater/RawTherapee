  /* [SYNOPSIS]
       This function is provided to facilitate run-time verification that the
       alignment conditions under which the core system was compiled are
       compatible with those under which an application or other library was
       built.  The check needs to be made at run-time to properly handle
       shared/dynamic libraries, catching conditions in which the core system
       may be assuming different alignment conditions to those that prevail
       at the point when a dependent application is built.
       [//]
       Applications should not need to invoke this function directly, but
       might consider invoking the function via the
       `kdu_check_sample_alignment' macro, that is called with function
       semantics, taking no arguments.  This should be done whenever an
       application provides its own SIMD accelerator functions that rely upon
       some alignemnt conditions that are tested via the macros defined in
       this header file.  The macro invokes this function with `return_on_fail'
       false and `strict' also false, which means that an error will be
       generated through `kdu_error' if and only if the alignment conditions
       under which the core system was compiled are less strict than those
       advertised by the macros above.
       [//]
       The function is called automatically by the `kdu_sample_allocator'
       object when it actually allocates memory; in that case, the
       `return_on_fail' argument is also false, but `strict' is set to true.
       This protects an application against the possibility that it allocates
       sample buffers itself using alignment that is less strict than that
       expected by the core system.
     [ARG: return_on_fail]
       If true, the function returns false, rather than generating an error
       through `kdu_error', in the event that incompatibility is detected.
     [ARG: strict]
       If true, the function considers alignment to be incompatible if any
       of the first four arguments differ from the values of the corresponding
       macros, as seen by the caller.  If this argument is false, the function
       considers alignment to be compatible so long as the alignment
       requirements represented by the first four arguments are no stronger
       than the values of the corresponding macros at the time when the
       core system was compiled.  For example, with `strict' false, it is
       OK if the core system was compiled with a `KDU_ALIGN_SAMPLE16' value
       that was larger than that supplied via the `align_sample16' argument, 
       but it is not OK if `KDU_ALIGN_SAMPLE16' was smaller than the value
       passed for the `align_sample16' argument.
