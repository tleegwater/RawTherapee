Description:
   Uniform interface to sample data processing services: DWT analysis; DWT
synthesis; subband sample encoding and decoding; colour and multi-component
transformation.  Here, we consider the encoder and decoder objects to be
sample data processing objects, since they accept or produce unquantized
subband samples.  They build on top of the block coding services defined in
"kdu_block_coding.h", adding quantization, ROI adjustments, appearance
transformations, and buffering to interface with the DWT.

     [SYNOPSIS]
     This object serves to prevent excessive memory fragmentation and
     provide useful memory alignment services.
     [//]
     Pre-allocation requests are made by all clients which wish to use
     its services, after which a single block of memory is allocated and
     the allocated memory is assigned in accordance with the original
     pre-allocation requests.  Memory chunks allocated by this
     object to a client are not be individually returned or recycled, since
     this incurs overhead and fragmentation.
     [//]
     The object may be re-used (after a call to its `restart' member) once
     all memory served out is no longer in use.  When re-used, the object
     makes every attempt to avoid destroying and re-allocating its memory
     block.  This avoids memory fragmentation and allocation overhead when
     processing images with multiple tiles or when used for video
     applications.
     [//]
     The object allocates memory in such a way that allocated buffers may
     be over-read by at least `KDU_OVERREAD_BYTES' bytes -- the value of
     this constant is typically 128, but a larger value might be required
     for SIMD architectures with extremely wide data paths.  Applications
     can legally read up to `KDU_OVERREAD_BYTES' bytes beyond the storage
     that has nominally been allocated and also up to `KDU_OVERREAD_BYTES'
     bytes before the storage that has nominally been allocated.  However,
     they may not generally write beyond the allocated storage without
     interfering with other buffers allocated by the same sample allocator.
     [//]
     Although the principle intent is to allocate storage for image
     samples (including transformed image samples), the object can also
     be used to allocate more general blocks of memory, taking advantage
     of the alignment support which it offers.

           (if `use_shorts' is true) or `alloc32' (if `use_shorts' is false).
           Space is reserved such that each of these `num_requests' allocations
           can return an appropriately aligned pointer to an array which offers
           entries at locations n in the range -`before' <= n < `after', where
           each entry is of type `kdu_sample16' (if `use_shorts'=true) or
           `kdu_sample32' (if `use_shorts'=false).
           [//]
           Reservation of storage proceeds with the following alignment
           considerations in mind:
           [>>] Entry 0 must be aligned on a multiple of `KDU_ALIGN_SAMPLES16'
               16-bit samples (if `use_shorts'=true) or `KDU_ALIGN_SAMPLES32'
               32-bit samples (if `use_shorts'=false).  For example, octet
               alignment is achieved if both these alignment constants are
               equal to 8 (they will never be smaller than 8), and this is
               sufficient for aligned vector processing on SIMD architectures
               up to and including AVX.  For SIMD processing with AVX2
               instructions, the `KDU_ALIGN_SAMPLES16' macro must be at least
               16, while for vector processing using the Intel MIC instruction
               set, both `KDU_ALIGN_SAMPLES16' and `KDU_ALIGN_SAMPLES32' must
               be at least 16.
           [>>] The space reserved `before' and `after' entry 0 is rounded up
                to an integer multiple of `KDU_ALIGN_SAMPLES16' 16-bit
                samples or `KDU_ALIGN_SAMPLES32' 32-bit samples, as
                appropriate.
           [>>] The entire allocated block of memory also satisfies any
                alignment constraints associated with an immediately
                preceding call to `pre_align', and there is an implicit call
                to pre-align that guarantees alignment on at least a
                `KDU_PREALIGN_BYTES'-byte boundary.

     reversible path, samples must be absolute 32- or 16-bit integers.  For
     irreversible processing, samples have a normalized representation, where
     the nominal range of the data is typically -0.5 to +0.5 (actual nominal
     ranges for the data supplied to a `kdu_encoder' or `kdu_analysis' object
     or retrieved from a `kdu_decoder' or `kdu_synthesis' object may be
     explicitly set in the relevant constructor).  These normalized quantities
     may have either a true 32-bit floating point representation or a 16-bit
     fixed-point representation.  In the latter case, the least significant
     `KDU_FIX_POINT' bits of the integer are interpreted as binary fraction
     bits, so that 2^{KDU_FIX_POINT} represents a normalized value of 1.0.
     [//]
     The object maintains sufficient space to allow access to a given number
     of samples before the first nominal sample (the one at index 0) and a
     given number of samples beyond the last nominal sample (the one at
     index `width'-1).  These extension lengths are explained in the
     comments appearing with `pre_create'.
     [//]
     From Kakadu version 7, this object supports "exchangeable" line buffers,
     which provide a means for passing data across interfaces without copying
     the sample values themselves.  When passed across a `kdu_push_ifc::push'
     or `kdu_pull_ifc::pull' interface, an exchangeable line buffer might
     be copied to/from a resource managed by the target object or else the
     underlying memory buffer might be exchanged with a compatible buffer
     managed by the target object.  Compatible buffers must the same `width',
     the same data type, and the same nominal `extend_width' and
     `extend_right' parameters.  To set things up for more consistent
     exchange of buffers, Kakadu version 7's sample data processing objects
     are moving towards the use of 0 for `extend_left' and `extend_right'.
     This is accomplished by doing boundary extension operations on-the-fly
     wherever possible, rather than through memory transactions.
     [//]
     Also, from Kakadu version 7, the final allocation of line buffers
     (after pre-allocation) can be performed from any thread of execution
     without needing to take out any mutual exclusion locks.  This is part
     of the effort to reduce thread dependencies in Kakadu, so that multiple
     CPU cores can be used more effectively.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Declares the characteristics of the internal storage which will
           later be created by `create'.  If `use_shorts' is true, the sample
           values will have 16 bits each and normalized values will use a
           fixed point representation with KDU_FIX_POINT fraction bits.
           Otherwise, the sample values have 32 bits each and normalized
           values use a true floating point representation.
           [//]
           This function essentially calls `allocator->pre_alloc', requesting
           enough storage for a line with `width' samples, providing for legal
           accesses up to `extend_left' samples before the beginning of the
           line and `extend_right' samples beyond the end of the line.
           [//]
           Note: from Kakadu version 7, the `extend_left' and `extend_right'
           arguments no longer have defaults, because we wish to encourage
           the use of 0 extensions whenever this is not too difficult.
           [//]
           The returned line buffer is guaranteed to be aligned on an L-byte
           boundary, the `extend_left' and `extend_right' values are rounded
           up to the nearest multiple of L bytes, and the length of the
           right-extended buffer is also rounded up to a multiple of L bytes,
           where L is 2*`KDU_ALIGN_SAMPLES16' for 16-bit samples
           (`use_shorts'=true) and 4*`KDU_ALIGN_SAMPLES32' for 32-bit samples
           (`use_shorts'=false).  Finally, it is possible to read at least
           `KDU_OVERREAD_BYTES' bytes beyond the end or before the start of
           the extended region, although writes to these extra bytes will
           generally overwrite data belonging to other buffers allocated
           by the `allocator' object.       
         [ARG: allocator]
           Pointer to the object which will later be used to complete the
           allocation of storage for the line.  The pointer is saved
           internally until such time as the `create' function is called, so
           you must be careful not to delete this object.  You must also be
           careful to call its `kdu_sample_allocator::finalize' function
           before calling `create'.
         [ARG: width]
           Nominal width of (number of samples in) the line.  Note that space
           reserved for access to `extend_left' samples to the left and
           `extend_right' samples to the right.  Moreover, additional
           samples may often be accessed to the left and right of the nominal
           line boundaries due to the alignment policy discussed above.
         [ARG: absolute]
           If true, the sample values in the line buffer are to be used in
           JPEG2000's reversible processing path, which works with absolute
           integers.  otherwise, the line is prepared for use with the
           irreversible processing path, which works with normalized
           (floating or fixed point) quantities.
         [ARG: use_shorts]
           If true, space is allocated for 16-bit sample values
           (array entries will be of type `kdu_sample16').  Otherwise, the
           line buffer will hold samples of type `kdu_sample32'.
         [ARG: extend_left]
           This quantity should be small, since it will be represented
           internally using 8-bit numbers, after rounding up to an
           appropriately aligned value.  It would be unusual to select
           values larger than 16 or perhaps 32.  If you intend to use this
           buffer in an exchange operation (see `set_exchangeable'), it is
           most likely best to use 0 for the `extend_left' and `extend_right'
           to encourage compatibility with the buffer with which you want
           to perform an exchange.
         [ARG: extend_right]
           This quantity should be small, since it will be represented
           internally using 8-bit numbers, after rounding up to an
           appropriately aligned value.  It would be unusual to select
           values larger than 16 or perhaps 32.

           constructed to process the subband data produced by the present
           node.
         [ARG: allocator]
           A `kdu_sample_allocator' object whose `finalize' member function
           has not yet been called must be supplied for pre-allocation of the
           various sample buffering arrays.  This same allocator will be
           shared by the entire DWT tree and by the `kdu_encoder' objects at
           its leaves.
         [ARG: use_shorts]
           Indicates whether 16-bit or 32-bit data representations are to be
           used.  The same type of representation must be used throughput the
           DWT processing chain and line buffers pushed into the DWT engine
           must use this representation.
         [ARG: normalization]
           Ignored for reversibly transformed data.  In the irreversible case,
           it indicates that the nominal range of data pushed into the
           `kdu_push_ifc::push' function will be from -0.5*R to 0.5*R, where
           R is the value of the `normalization' argument.  This
           capability is provided primarily to allow normalization steps to
           be skipped or approximated with simple powers of 2 during lifting
           implementations of the DWT; the factors can be folded into
           quantization step sizes.  The best way to use the normalization
           argument will generally depend upon the implementation of the DWT.
         [ARG: roi]
           If non-NULL, this argument points to an appropriately
           derived ROI node object, which may be used to recover region of
           interest mask information for the present tile-component.  In this
           case, the present function will automatically construct an ROI
           processing tree to provide access to derived ROI information in
           each individual subband.  The `roi::release' function will
           be called when the present object is destroyed -- possibly
           sooner (if it can be determined that ROI information is no
           longer required).
         [ARG: env]
           Supply a non-NULL argument here if you want to enable
           multi-threaded processing.  After creating a cooperating
           thread group by following the procedure outlined in the
           description of `kdu_thread_env', any one of the threads may
           be used to construct this processing engine.  However, you
           MUST TAKE CARE to create all objects which share the same
           `allocator' object from the same thread.
           [//]
           Separate processing queues will automatically be created for each
           subband, allowing multiple threads to be scheduled
           simultaneously to process code-block data for the corresponding
           tile-component.  Also, multiple tile-components may be processed
           concurrently and the available thread resources will be allocated
           amongst the total collection of job queues as required.
           [//]
           By and large, you can use this object in exactly the same way
           when `env' is non-NULL as you would with a NULL `env' argument.
           That is, the use of multi-threaded processing can be largely
           transparent.  However, you must remember the following three
           points:
           [>>] All objects which share the same `allocator' must be created
                using the same thread.  Thereafter, the actual processing
                may proceed on different threads.
           [>>] You must supply a non-NULL `env' argument to the
                `kdu_push_ifc::push' function -- it need not refer to the
                same thread as the one used to create the object here, but
                it must belong to the same thread group.
           [>>] You cannot rely upon all processing being complete until you
                invoke the `kdu_thread_entity::join' or
                `kdu_thread_entity::terminate' function.
         [ARG: env_queue]
           This argument is ignored unless `env' is non-NULL.  When `env'
           is non-NULL, all thread queues which are created inside this object
           are added as sub-queues of `env_queue'.  If `env_queue' is NULL,
           all thread queues which are created inside this object are added
           as top-level queues in the multi-threaded queue hierarchy.  The
           `kdu_analysis' object does not directly create any
           `kdu_thread_queue' objects, but it passes `env_queue' along to
           the `kdu_encoder' objects that it constructs to process each
           transformed subband and each of those objects does create a
           thread queue which is made a descendant of `env_queue'.
           [//]
           One advantage of supplying a non-NULL `env_queue' is that it
           provides you with a single hook for joining with the completion
           of all the thread queues which are created by this object
           and its descendants -- see `kdu_thread_entity::join' for more on
           this.
           [//]
           A second advantage of supplying a non-NULL `env_queue' is that
           it allows you to manipulate the sequencing indices that are
           assigned by the thread queues created internally -- see
           `kdu_thread_entity::attach_queue' for more on the role played by
           sequencing indices in controlling the order in which work is
           actually done.  In particular, if `env_queue' is initially
           added to the thread group with a sequencing index of N >= 0, each
           `kdu_encoder' object created as a result of the present call will
           also have a sequencing index of N.
           [//]
           Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the `env_queue' object
           supplied here provides a mechanism to determine whether or not
           calls to `push' might potentially block.  This is achieved by
           means of the `env_queue->update_dependencies' function that is
           invoked from within the `kdu_encoder' object, following the
           conventions outlined with the definition of the `kdu_encoder'
           object's constructor.  What this means is that if
           `env_queue->check_dependencies' returns false, the next call to
           this object's `kdu_push_ifc::push' function should not block the
           caller.  The `kdu_multi_analysis' object uses a derived
           `kdu_thread_queue' object to automatically schedule DWT analysis
           jobs only once it knows that they will not be blocked by missing
           dependencies.
         [ARG: flags]
           Used to access extended functionality.  Currently, the only
           defined flags are:
           [>>] `KDU_LINE_WILL_BE_EXTENDED' -- if this flag is defined,
                the caller is intending to push in lines that have been
                created with an `extend_right' value of 1.  That is,
                `kdu_line_buf' objects supplied to the `push' function will
                have an extra sample beyond the nominal end of the
                line in question.  Knowing this, the current object may
                allocate internal storage to have the same extended length
                so as to maximize the chance that internal calls to
                `kdu_line_buf::exchange' will succeed in performing an
                efficient data exchange without copying of sample values.
                This flag is provided primarily to allow efficient DWT
                implementations to work with buffers that have an equal
                amount of storage for low- and high-pass horizontal subbands.
                In practice, the flag will only be set for horizontal low
                (resp. high) subbands that are shorter (by 1) than the
                corresponding horizontal high (resp. low) subband, where
                the longer subband cannot be spanned by the same number
                of octets as the shorter subband; this is a relatively unusual
                condition, but still worth catering for. The application
                itself would not normally set this flag.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Constructing an instance of this class for the primary node of
           a tile-component's highest visible resolution, will cause the
           constructor to recursively create instances of the class for
           each successive DWT stage and also for the block decoding process.
           [//]
           The recursive construction process supports all wavelet
           decomposition structures allowed by the JPEG2000 standard,
           including packet wavelet transforms, and transforms with
           different horizontal and vertical downsampling factors.  The
           `node' object used to construct the top level `kdu_synthesis'
           object will typically be the primary node of a `kdu_resolution'
           object, obtained by calling `kdu_resolution::access_node'.  In
           fact, for backward compatibility with Kakadu versions 4.5 and
           earlier, a second constructor is provided, which does just this.
           [//]
           This function takes optional `env' and `env_queue' arguments to
           support a variety of multi-threaded processing paradigms, to
           leverage the capabilities of multi-processor platforms.  To see
           how this works, consult the description of these arguments below.
           To initiate processing as soon as possible, you might like to
           call `kdu_pull_ifc::start' once you have finished creating all
           objects which share the supplied `allocator' object and invoked
           its `kdu_sample_allocator::finalize' function.  Otherwise,
           background processing (on other threads) will not commence until
           the first call to `kdu_pull_ifc::pull'.
         [ARG: node]
           Interface to the DWT decomposition node for which the object is
           being created.  The synthesis stage reconstructs the image
           associated with that node by combining the subband images
           produced by each of the node's children.  If the child node is
           a leaf (a final subband), a `kdu_decoder' object is created to
           recover the data for that subband.  Otherwise, another
           `kdu_synthesis' object is recursively constructed to retrieve
           the child's subband data.
         [ARG: allocator]
           A `kdu_sample_allocator' object whose `finalize' member function
           has not yet been called must be supplied for pre-allocation of the
           various sample buffering arrays.  This same allocator will be
           shared by the entire DWT tree and by the `kdu_decoder' objects at
           its leaves.
         [ARG: use_shorts]
           Indicates whether 16-bit or 32-bit data representations are to be
           used.  The same type of representation must be used throughput the
           DWT processing chain and line buffers pulled from the DWT synthesis
           engine must use this representation.
         [ARG: normalization]
           Ignored for reversibly transformed data.  In the irreversible case,
           it indicates that the nominal range of data recovered from the
           `kdu_pull_ifc::pull' function will be from -0.5*R to 0.5*R, where
           R is the value of the `normalization' argument.  This
           capability is provided primarily to allow normalization steps to
           be skipped or approximated with simple powers of 2 during lifting
           implementations of the DWT; the factors can be folded into
           quantization step sizes.  The best way to use the normalization
           argument will generally depend upon the implementation of the DWT.
         [ARG: pull_offset]
           Applications should leave this argument set to 0.  The internal
           implementation uses this to maintain horizontal alignment
           properties for efficient memory access, when synthesizing a
           region of interest within the image.  The first `pull_offset'
           entries in each `kdu_line_buf' object supplied to the `pull'
           function are not used; the function should write the requested
           sample values into the remainder of the line buffer, whose
           width (`kdu_line_buf::get_width') is guaranteed to be `pull_offset'
           samples larger than the width of the region in that subband.
           In any event, offsets should be small, since the internal
           representation stores them and various derived quantities
           using 8-bit fields to keep the memory footprint as small
           as possible.
         [ARG: env]
           Supply a non-NULL argument here if you want to enable
           multi-threaded processing.  After creating a cooperating
           thread group by following the procedure outlined in the
           description of `kdu_thread_env', any one of the threads may
           be used to construct this processing engine.  However, you
           MUST TAKE CARE to create all objects which share the same
           `allocator' object from the same thread.
           [//]
           Separate processing queues will automatically be created for each
           subband, allowing multiple threads to be scheduled simultaneously
           to process code-block samples for the corresponding
           tile-component.  Also, multiple tile-components may be processed
           concurrently and the available thread resources will be allocated
           amongst the total collection of job queues as required.
           [//]
           By and large, you can use this object in exactly the same way
           when `env' is non-NULL as you would with a NULL `env' argument.
           That is, the use of multi-threaded processing can be largely
           transparent.  However, you must remember the following two
           points:
           [>>] All objects which share the same `allocator' must be created
                using the same thread.  Thereafter, the actual processing
                may proceed on different threads.
           [>>] You must supply a non-NULL `env' argument to the
                `kdu_push_ifc::push' function -- it need not refer to the
                same thread as the one used to create the object here, but
                it must belong to the same thread group.
         [ARG: env_queue]
           This argument is ignored unless `env' is non-NULL.  When `env'
           is non-NULL, all job queues which are created inside this object
           are added as sub-queues of `env_queue'.  If `env_queue' is NULL,
           all thread queues which are created inside this object are added
           as top-level queues in the multi-threaded queue hierarchy.  The
           `kdu_synthesis' object does not directly create any
           `kdu_thread_queue' objects, but it passes `env_queue' along to
           the `kdu_decoder' objects that it constructs to decode each
           subband and each of those objects does create a
           thread queue which is made a descendant of `env_queue'.
           [//]
           One advantage of supplying a non-NULL `env_queue' is that it
           provides you with a single hook for joining with the completion
           of all the thread queues which are created by this object
           and its descendants -- see `kdu_thread_entity::join' for more on
           this.
           [//]
           A second advantage of supplying a non-NULL `env_queue' is that
           it allows you to manipulate the sequencing indices that are
           assigned by the thread queues created internally -- see
           `kdu_thread_entity::attach_queue' for more on the role played by
           sequencing indices in controlling the order in which work is
           actually done.  In particular, if `env_queue' is initially
           added to the thread group with a sequencing index of N >= 0, each
           `kdu_decoder' object created as a result of the present call will
           also have a sequencing index of N.
           [//]
           Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the `env_queue' object
           supplied here provides a mechanism to determine whether or not
           calls to `pull' might potentially block.  This is achieved by
           means of the `env_queue->update_dependencies' function that is
           invoked from within the `kdu_decoder' object, following the
           conventions outlined with the definition of the `kdu_decoder'
           object's constructor.  What this means is that if
           `env_queue->check_dependencies' returns false, the next call to
           this object's `kdu_pull_ifc::pull' function should not block the
           caller.  The `kdu_multi_synthesis' object uses a derived
           `kdu_thread_queue' object to automatically schedule DWT synthesis
           jobs only once it knows that they will not be blocked by missing
           dependencies.
         [ARG: flags]
           Used to access extended functionality.  Currently, the only
           defined flags are:
           [>>] `KDU_LINE_WILL_BE_EXTENDED' -- if this flag is defined,
                the caller is intending to pull data into line buffers that
                have been created with an `extend_right' value of 1.  That is,
                `kdu_line_buf' objects supplied to the `pull' function will
                have an extra sample beyond the nominal end of the
                line in question.  Knowing this, the current object may
                allocate internal storage to have the same extended length
                so as to maximize the chance that internal calls to
                `kdu_line_buf::exchange' will succeed in performing an
                efficient data exchange without copying of sample values.
                This flag is provided primarily to allow efficient DWT
                implementations to work with buffers that have an equal
                amount of storage for low- and high-pass horizontal subbands.
                In practice, the flag will only be set for horizontal low
                (resp. high) subbands that are shorter (by 1) than the
                corresponding horizontal high (resp. low) subband, where
                the longer subband cannot be spanned by the same number
                of octets as the shorter subband; this is a relatively unusual
                condition, but still worth catering for. The application
                itself would not normally set this flag.

           provides an appropriately derived `kdu_roi_node' object whose
           `kdu_roi_node::pull' function may be used to recover ROI mask
           information for this subband.  Its `kdu_roi::release' function will
           be called when the encoder is destroyed -- possibly sooner, if it
           can be determined that ROI information is no longer required.
           [//]
           The optional `env' and `env_queue' arguments support a variety
           of multi-threaded processing paradigms, to leverage the
           capabilities of multi-processor platforms.  To see how this works,
           consult the description of these arguments below.
         [ARG: env]
           If non-NULL, the behaviour of the underlying
           `kdu_push_ifc::push' function is changed radically.  In
           particular, a job queue is created by this constructor, to enable
           asynchronous multi-threaded processing of the code-block samples.
           Once sufficient lines have been pushed to the subband to enable
           the encoding of a row of code-blocks, the processing of these
           code-blocks is not done immediately, as it is if `env' is NULL.
           Instead, one or more jobs are added to the mentioned queue,
           to be serviced by any available thread in the group to which
           `env' belongs.  You should remember the following three
           points:
           [>>] All objects which share the same `allocator' must be created
                using the same thread.  Thereafter, the actual processing
                may proceed on different threads.
           [>>] You must supply a non-NULL `env' argument to the
                `kdu_push_ifc::push' function -- it need not refer to the
                same thread as the one used to create the object here, but
                it must belong to the same thread group.
           [>>] You cannot rely upon all processing being complete until you
                invoke the `kdu_thread_entity::join' or
                `kdu_thread_entity::terminate' function.
         [ARG: env_queue]
           If `env' is NULL, this argument is ignored; otherwise, the job
           queue which is created by this constructor will be made a
           sub-queue of any supplied `env_queue'.  If `env_queue' is NULL,
           the queue created to process code-blocks within this
           tile-component-subband will be a top-level queue in the
           multi-threaded queue hierarchy.
           [//]
           The `env_queue->update_dependencies' function is invoked with
           a `new_dependencies' value of 1 whenever a call to `push'
           causes this object's internal subband sample buffer to become
           full, so that a subsequent call to `push' might require the caller
           to block until the buffer has been cleared by block encoding
           operations.  The `env_queue->update_dependencies' function is
           invoked with a `new_dependencies' value of -1 whenever block
           encoding operations cause a previously full subband sample buffer
           to become available to receive new data, so that a subsequent
           call to `push' will not block the caller.
           [//]
           For more on the role and benefits of the `env_queue' argument,
           see the discussion of this argument's namesake within the
           `kdu_analysis' constructor, as well as the discussion that appears
           with the definition of `kdu_thread_queue::update_dependencies'.
         [ARG: flags]
           Used to access extended functionality.  Currently, the only
           defined flags are:
           [>>] `KDU_LINE_WILL_BE_EXTENDED' -- if this flag is defined,
                the caller is intending to push in line buffers that
                have been created with an `extend_right' value of 1.  That is,
                `kdu_line_buf' objects supplied to the `push' function will
                have an extra sample beyond the nominal end of the
                line in question.  Knowing this, the current object may
                allocate internal storage to have the same extended length
                so as to maximize the chance that internal calls to
                `kdu_line_buf::exchange' will succeed in performing an
                efficient data exchange without copying of sample values.
                This flag is provided primarily to allow efficient DWT
                implementations to work with buffers that have an equal
                amount of storage for low- and high-pass horizontal subbands.
                In practice, the flag will only be set for horizontal low
                (resp. high) subbands that are shorter (by 1) than the
                corresponding horizontal high (resp. low) subband, where
                the longer subband cannot be spanned by the same number
                of octets as the shorter subband; this is a relatively unusual
                condition, but still worth catering for. The application
                itself would not normally set this flag.

           Processing of code-blocks commences once the first call to
           `kdu_pull_ifc::pull' or `kdu_pull_ifc::start' arrives.  The latter
           approach is preferred, since it allows parallel processing of
           the various subbands in a tile-component to commence immediately
           without waiting for DWT dependencies to be satisfied.  You should
           remember the following two points:

     [SYNOPSIS]
       This powerful object generalizes the functionality of `kdu_analysis'
       to the processing of multiple image components, allowing all the
       data for a tile to be managed by a single object.  The object
       creates the `kdu_analysis' objects required to process each
       codestream image component, but it also implements Part-2 non-linear
       point transforms (NLT), if applicable, plus Part-1 colour
       decorrelation transforms and Part-2 generalized multi-component
       transforms, as required.
       [//]
       Objects of this class serve as interfaces.  The constructor
       simply creates an empty interface, and there is no meaningful
       destructor.  This means that you may copy and transfer objects
       of this class at will, without any impact on internal resources.
       To create a meaningful insance of the internal machine, you must
       use the `create' member.  To destroy the internal machine you
       must use the `destroy' member.
       [//]
       From Kakadu version 7.5, you can pass a reference to an external
       `kdu_sample_allocator' object to be used in place of the internal
       one.  This is useful in NUMA multi-processor systems where the
       haphazard creation and destruction of `kdu_multi_analysis' engines
       might otherwise result in the sample data memory being allocated
       disadvantageously.  By retaining an allocated memory buffer inside
       an external `kdu_sample_allocator' you can arrange for that buffer to
       reside in memory that is both stable across multiple create/destroy
       events and close to a processor that may be associated with the
       threads in a `kdu_thread_env' multi-threaded environment that you
       are using.  In the future, `kdu_sample_allocator' may be extended to
       include additional customization tools that could be brought to bear
       upon the `kdu_multi_analysis' engine by use of this new external
       allocator feature.

           but they will have no impact on the way in which codestream
           components are generated and subjected to spatial wavelet
           transformation and coding.

           If insufficient components are currently marked as being
           of interest (i.e., too many components were excluded in a
           previous call to `kdu_tile::set_components_of_interest'), the
           present object might not be able to find a way of inverting
           the multi-component transformation network, so as to work back
           to codestream image components.  In this case, an informative
           error message will be generated through `kdu_error'.

           This function takes optional `env' and `env_queue' arguments to
           support a variety of multi-threaded processing paradigms, to
           leverage the capabilities of multi-processor platforms.  To see
           how this works, consult the description of these arguments below.
           Also, pay close attention to the use of `env' arguments with the
           `exchange_line' and `destroy' functions.
           [//]
           The `flags' argument works together with subsequent arguments
           to control internal memory allocation, flow control and
           optimization policies.  See below for a description of the
           available flags.
         [RETURNS]
           Returns the number of bytes which have been allocated internally
           for the processing of multi-component transformations,
           spatial wavelet transforms and intermediate buffering between
           the wavelet and block coder engines.  Essentially, this
           includes all memory resources, except for those managed by the
           `kdu_codestream' machinery (for structural information and
           code-block bit-streams).  The latter information can be recovered
           by querying the `kdu_codestream::get_compressed_data_memory' and
           `kdu_codestream::get_compressed_state_memory' functions.
         [ARG: env]
           Supply a non-NULL argument here if you want to enable
           multi-threaded processing.  After creating a cooperating
           thread group by following the procedure outlined in the
           description of `kdu_thread_env', any one of the threads may
           be used to construct this processing engine.  Separate
           processing queues will automatically be created for each
           image component.
           [//]
           If the `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT' flag (or the `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DBUF'
           flag) is supplied, these queues will also be used to schedule the
           spatial wavelet transform operations associated with each image
           component as jobs to be processed asynchronously by different
           threads.  Regardless multi-threaded DWT processing is requested,
           within each tile-component, separate queues are created to allow
           simultaneous processing of code-blocks from different subbands.
           [//]
           By and large, you can use this object in exactly the same way
           when `env' is non-NULL as you would with a NULL `env' argument.
           That is, the use of multi-threaded processing can be largely
           transparent.  However, you must remember the following two
           points:
           [>>] You must supply a non-NULL `env' argument to the
                `exchange_line' function -- it need not refer to the same
                thread as the one used to create the object here, but it
                must belong to the same thread group.
           [>>] You cannot rely upon all processing being complete until you
                invoke the `kdu_thread_entity::join' or
                `kdu_thread_entity::terminate' function.
         [ARG: env_queue]
           This argument is ignored unless `env' is non-NULL.  When `env'
           is non-NULL, all thread queues that are created inside this object
           are added as sub-queues of `env_queue'.  If `env_queue' is NULL,
           they are added as top-level queues in the multi-threaded queue
           hierarchy.  The present object creates one internal queue for each
           tile-component, to which each subband adds a sub-queue managed by
           `kdu_encoder'.
           [//]
           One advantage of supplying a non-NULL `env_queue' is that it
           provides you with a single hook for joining with the completion
           of all the thread queues which are created by this object
           and its descendants -- see `kdu_thread_entity::join' for more on
           this.
           [//]
           A second advantage of supplying a non-NULL `env_queue' is that
           it allows you to manipulate the sequencing indices that are
           assigned by the thread queues created internally -- see
           `kdu_thread_entity::attach_queue' for more on the role played by
           sequencing indices in controlling the order in which work is
           actually done.  In particular, if `env_queue' is initially
           added to the thread group with a sequencing index of N >= 0,
           all processing within all tile-components of the tile associated
           with this object will proceed with jobs having a sequence index
           of N.
           [//]
           Finally, the `env_queue' object supplied here provides a
           mechanism to determine whether or not calls to `excahnge_line'
           might potentially block.  This may be achieved by supplying
           an `env_queue' object whose `kdu_thread_queue::update_dependencies'
           function has been overridden, or by registering a dependency
           monitor (see `kdu_thread_queue::set_dependency_monitor') with
           the supplied `env_queue'.  If the number of potentially blocking
           dependencies identified by either of these mechanisms is 0,
           calls to `exchange_line' can be invoked at least once for each
           component index, without blocking the caller.  Otherwise, the
           caller might be temporarily blocked while waiting for
           dependencies to be satisfied by DWT analysis and/or subband
           encoding operations that are still in progress.  This temporary
           blocking is not a huge concern, since threads actually enter
           what we call a "working wait", using
           `kdu_thread_entity::wait_for_condition', during which they will
           often perform other tasks.  However, working waits can adversely
           affect cache utilization and often cause work to be done in a
           less than ideal sequence, so that other threads might go idle
           while waiting for jobs to be scheduled by a thread that is
           unduly delayed in a working wait.  For this reason, advanced
           implementations are offered the option of using the dependency
           analysis methods associated with an `env_queue' to schedule jobs
           only when it is known that they are fully ready to proceed.
         [ARG: flags]
           Controls the internal memory allocation, buffer management
           and various processing options.  This argument may be the
           logical OR of any appropriate combination of the flags listed
           below.  For convenience, the `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DEFAULT_FLAGS'
           value may be used as a starting point, which will supply the
           flags that should always be present unless you have good reason
           not to include them.
           [>>] `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_PRECISE':  This option requests
                the internal machinery to work with 32-bit representations
                for all image component samples.  Otherwise, the internal
                machinery will determine a suitable representation precision,
                making every attempt to use lower precision processing
                paths, which are faster and consume less memory, so long
                as this does not unduly compromise quality.
           [>>] `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_FAST':  This option represents
                the opposite extreme in precision selection to that
                associated with `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_PRECISE'.  In fact,
                if both flags are supplied, the present one will be ignored.
                Otherwise, if the present flag is supplied, the function
                selects the lowest possible internal processing precision,
                even if this does sacrifice some image quality.
           [>>] `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DBUF': Same as `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT' --
                see below.
           [>>] `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT': This flag is ignored
                unless `env' is non-NULL.  It specifies that the
                spatial DWT operations associated with each codestream
                image component should be executed as asynchronous jobs, as
                opposed to synchronously when new imagery is pushed in
                via the `exchange_line' function.  When the flag is present,
                the object allocates an internal buffer which can hold
                (approximately) 2*`buffer_rows' lines for each
                codestream tile-component.  In the simplest case (double
                buffering), this buffer is partitioned into two parts.  More
                generally, though, the implementation may partition the
                memory into a larger number of parts to improve
                performance.  At any given time, the MCT machinery may be
                writing data to one part while the DWT and block coding
                machinery may be supplied with data from another part.
                Multi-threaded DWT processing provides a useful
                mechanism for minimizing CPU idle time, since multiple threads
                can be scheduled not only to block encoding operations, but
                also to DWT analysis operations.  If DWT analysis is
                the bottleneck, it fundamentally limits the rate at which
                block encoding jobs can be made available to the
                multi-threaded machinery; the only way to overcome this
                bottleneck, if it exists, is to allocate multiple threads to
                DWT analysis via this flag.
         [ARG: roi]
           A non-NULL object may be passed in via this argument to
           allow for region-of-interest driven encoding.  Note carefully,
           however, that the component indices supplied to the
           `kdu_roi_image::acquire_node' function correspond to
           codestream image components.  It is up to you to ensure that
           the correct geometry is returned for each codestream image
           component, in the event that the source image components do not
           map directly (component for component) to codestream image
           components.
         [ARG: buffer_rows]
           This argument must be strictly positive.  It is used to size the
           internal buffers used to hold data that finds its way to the
           individual codestream tile-components, while it is waiting to be
           passed to the DWT analysis and block coding machinery.
           [//]
           From KDU-7.2.1 on, a value of 0 is automatically translated to 1,
           while a -ve value may be supplied for this argument, in which case
           the buffers will be dimensioned automatically, taking the tile
           width and number of components into account.
           [//]
           There are two important cases to understand:
           [>>] If the DWT processing is performed in-line, in the same thread
                as that which calls `exchange_line', then there is only one
                buffer, with this number of rows, and the buffer must be
                filled (or the tile-component exhausted) before DWT processing
                is performed.  In this case, it is usually best to select
                the default value of `buffer_rows'=1 so that processing can
                start as early as possible and there is less chance that the
                image component data will be evicted from lower levels of the
                CPU cache before it is subjected to DWT analysis.  However,
                in the special case where multi-threaded processing is
                employed, with both `env' AND `env_queue' arguments to this
                function being non-NULL, and where the `env_queue' or
                one of the super-queues in its ancestry advertises its
                interest in propagated dependency information (through an
                overridden `kdu_thread_queue::update_dependencies' function
                that returns true, for example, or an installed dependency
                monitor), then there are some multi-threaded synchronization
                overheads associated with the onset and completion of the
                internal DWT analysis machinery (perhaps amounting to several
                hundred or even a thousand clock cycles), so in this case it
                may be better to select a larger value for `buffer_rows',
                especially where the line width is small.
           [>>] If the `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT' or `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DBUF' flag
                is present, the DWT operations are performed by jobs that may
                be executed on any thread within the multi-threaded environment
                associated with the `env' argument.  In this case, for reasons
                of backward compatibility, the total amount of memory
                allocated for buffering tile-component lines is given (at
                least approximately) by 2*`buffer_rows', since this is what
                would be consumed if a double buffering strategy were
                employed.  In reality, the internal implementation may
                partition this total amount of memory into a larger number
                of smaller buffers so that processing can start earlier and
                the memory can be used more effectively to manage interruption
                of threads, or scheduling of thread resources temporarily to
                other jobs.
           [//]
           You may need to play with this parameter to optimize
           processing efficiency for particular applications.
           [//]
           You should be aware that the actual number of buffer lines
           allocated internally may be smaller than that requested.  For
           example, the implementation may limit the total amount of
           buffer memory to 256 lines.
         [ARG: external_sample_allocator]
           If desired, you may pass your own `kdu_sample_allocator' object in
           via this argument.  The most immediate benefit of doing this is
           that the allocator will not be deleted when the current object
           is `destroy'ed so you can pass the same allocator back into a newly
           created instances of the same object and hope to wind up using
           exactly the same memory space for sample data processing and
           subband buffers for block coding.  Since the buffers allocated by
           `kdu_sample_allocator' tend to be large, this may be very
           important, especially in NUMA (Non-Uniform Machine Architecture)
           platforms where most operating systems assign physical pages in
           memory based on the location of the CPUs that first touch them.
           [//]
           The `external_sample_allocator' may not safely be shared with any
           other object, since the internal machinery here invokes
           `kdu_sample_allocator::reset' and `kdu_sample_allocator::finalize'.
           [//]
           The `destroy' function will not delete any memory retained within
           an `external_sample_allocator' supplied here.
         [ARG: extra_params]
           This reserved argument has no impact on this version of Kakadu.

      { return state->exchange_line(comp_idx,written,env); }
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Use this function to exchange image data with the processing
           engine.  If `written' is NULL, you are only asking for access
           to a line buffer, into which to write a new line of image
           data for the component in question.  Once you have written
           to the supplied line buffer, you pass it back as the `written'
           argument in a subsequent call to this function.  Regardless
           of whether `written' is NULL, the function returns a pointer
           to the single internal line buffer which it maintains for each
           original image component, if and only if that line buffer is
           currently available for writing.  It will not be available if
           the internal machinery is waiting for a line of another component
           before it can process the data which has already been supplied.
           Thus, if a newly written line can be processed immediately, the
           function will return a non-NULL pointer even in the call with
           `written' non-NULL.  If it must wait for other component lines
           to arrive, however, it will return NULL.  Once returning non-NULL,
           the function will continue to return the same line buffer at
           least until the next call which supplies a non-NULL `written'
           argument.  This is because the current line number is incremented
           only by calls which supply a non-NULL `written' argument.
           [//]
           Note that all lines processed by this function should have a
           signed representation, regardless of whether or not
           `kdu_codestream::get_signed' reports that the components
           are signed.
         [RETURNS]
           Non-NULL if a line is available for writing.  That same line
           should be passed back to the function as its `written' argument
           in a subsequent call to the function (not necessarily the next
           one) in order to advance to a new line.  If the function returns
           NULL, you may have reached the end of the tile (you
           should know this), or else the object may be waiting for you
           to supply new lines for other image components which must
           be processed together with this one.
         [ARG: comp_idx]
           Index of the component for which a line is being written or
           requested.  This index must lie in the range 0 to Cs-1, where
           Cs is the `num_source_components' value supplied to
           `create'.
         [ARG: written]
           If non-NULL, this argument must be identical to the line buffer
           which was previously returned by the function, using the same
           `comp_idx' value.  In this case, the line is deemed to contain
           valid image data and the internal line counter for this component
           will be incremented before the function returns.  Otherwise,
           you are just asking the function to give you access to the
           internal line buffer so that you can write to it.
         [ARG: env]
           Must be non-NULL if and only if a non-NULL `env' argument was
           passed into `create'.  Any non-NULL `env' argument must identify
           the calling thread, which need not necessarily be the one used
           to create the object in the first place.

           Otherwise, calls to `exchange_line' will return lines whose

           In the presence of multi-component and/or non-linear point
           transforms, this can be non-trivial to figure out based solely
           on the output component index.
           [//]
           It is worth noting that any component that has an associated
           non-linear point transform with one of the types `NLType_SMAG'
           or `NLType_UMAG' will appear to the application with an absolute
           integer representation, even if all compression processing is
           irreversible.  This is done intentionally to facilitate the use of
           the SMAG and UMAG transforms in compressing float or half-float
           original image samples that have been cast (re-interpreted) as
           integers.  In such cases, all that need be done with the line
           buffers returned by `exchange_line' is to fill their sample values
           with original float or half-float values that have been
           re-interpreted as integers, possibly with some bit-shifting to
           accommodate any differences in exponent and mantissa precision
           from those of the standard IEEE float or half-float models.
           Components identified as unsigned must also be level shifted in
           the usual way after being re-interpreted as integers.

class kdu_multi_synthesis {
  /* [BIND: interface]
     [SYNOPSIS]
       This powerful object generalizes the functionality of `kdu_synthesis'
       to the processing of multiple image components, allowing all the
       data for a tile (or any subset thereof) to be reconstructed by a
       single object.  The object creates the `kdu_synthesis' objects
       required to process each required codestream image component, but it
       also inverts any Part-1 colour decorrelation transforms (RCT and ICT)
       and Part-2 generalized multi-component transforms, as required, and
       passes the result through any Part-2 non-linear point transforms (NLT)
       that might be applicable.
       [//]
       Objects of this class serve as interfaces.  The constructor
       simply creates an empty interface, and there is no meaningful
       destructor.  This means that you may copy and transfer objects
       of this class at will, without any impact on internal resources.
       To create a meaningful insance of the internal machine, you must
       use the `create' member.  To destroy the internal machine you
       must use the `destroy' member.
       [//]
       To use this object, one typically invokes `create', followed by
       calls to `get_line' and then ultimately `destroy'.  In multi-threaded
       processing environments, one typically passes a `kdu_thread_queue'
       super-queue to the `create' function and invokes
       `kdu_thread_entity::terminate' on this super-queue prior to the
       call to `destroy'.  In multi-threaded multi-tiled environments,
       where multiple tiles are to be processed concurrently (as opposed
       to sequentially), it is generally preferable to include the
       `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DELAYED_START' flag in the call to `create' and
       use the `start' function in the recommended manner prior to the
       first call to `get_line', although this is not required and might
       not make much difference in many cases, due to the ability of the
       internal machinery to compensate.
       [//]
       From Kakadu version 7.5, you can pass a reference to an external
       `kdu_sample_allocator' object to be used in place of the internal
       one.  This is useful in NUMA multi-processor systems where the
       haphazard creation and destruction of `kdu_multi_synthesis' engines
       might otherwise result in the sample data memory being allocated
       disadvantageously.  By retaining an allocated memory buffer inside
       an external `kdu_sample_allocator' you can arrange for that buffer to
       reside in memory that is both stable across multiple create/destroy
       events and close to a processor that may be associated with the
       threads in a `kdu_thread_env' multi-threaded environment that you
       are using.  In the future, `kdu_sample_allocator' may be extended to
       include additional customization tools that could be brought to bear
       upon the `kdu_multi_synthesis' engine by use of this new external
       allocator feature.

           Use this function to create an instance of the internal
           processing machinery, for decompressing data associated with
           the supplied open `tile' interface.  Until you call this
           function (or copy another object which has been created), the
           `exists' function will return false.
           [//]
           Note carefully that the output components which will be
           decompressed are affected by any previous calls to
           `kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions'.  You may use either
           of the two forms of that function to modify the set of output
           components which appear to be present.  If called with an
           `access_mode' argument of `KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS', the
           present object will present codestream image components as though
           they were the final output image components.  If, however,
           `kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions' was called with a
           component `access_mode' argument of `KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS',
           or if it has never been called, the present object will present
           output components in their fullest form, after processing by any
           required inverse multi-component decomposition, if necessary.  In
           either case, the set of components which is presented is
           identical to that which appears via the various `kdu_codestream'
           interface functions, such as `kdu_codestream::get_num_components',
           `kdu_codestream::get_bit_depth', and so forth, in each case
           with the optional `want_output_comps' argument set to true.
           [//]
           The behaviour of this function is affected by calls to
           `kdu_tile::set_components_of_interest'.  In particular, any of the
           apparent output components which have been identified as
           uninteresting, will not be generated by the multi-component
           transformation network -- they will, instead, appear to contain
           constant sample values.   Of course, you will probably not want
           to access these constant components, or else you would not have
           marked them as uninteresting; however, you can access them if you
           wish without incurring any processing overhead.
           [//]
           The `env' and `env_queue' arguments may be used to implement a
           a variety of multi-threaded processing paradigms, to leverage
           the capabilities of multi-processor platforms.  To see how this
           works, consult the description of these arguments below.  Also,
           play close attention to the use of `env' arguments with the
           `get_line' and `destroy' functions.
           [//]
           The `flags' argument works together with subsequent arguments
           to control internal memory allocation, flow control and
           optimization policies.  See below for a description of the
           available flags.
           [//]
           If you are working with tiled images and you are intending to
           create multiple `kdu_multi_synthesis' engines from which image
           component lines will be retrieved in round-robbin fashion (typical
           for scan-line oriented processing of tiled imagery), it may be
           worth paying attention to the `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DELAYED_START'
           flag and the `start' function, both of which are new to Kakadu
           v7, where they play an important role in maximizing the efficiency
           for multi-threaded processing environments involving a large number
           of threads.
         [RETURNS]
           Returns the number of bytes which have been allocated internally
           for the processing of multi-component transformations,
           spatial wavelet transforms and intermediate buffering between
           the wavelet and block decoder engines.  Essentially, this
           includes all memory resources, except for those managed by the
           `kdu_codestream' machinery (for structural information and
           code-block bit-streams).  The latter information can be recovered
           by querying the `kdu_codestream::get_compressed_data_memory' and
           `kdu_codestream::get_compressed_state_memory' functions.
         [ARG: env]
           Supply a non-NULL argument here if you want to enable
           multi-threaded processing.  After creating a cooperating
           thread group by following the procedure outlined in the
           description of `kdu_thread_env', any one of the threads may
           be used to construct this processing engine.  Separate
           processing queues will automatically be created for each
           image component.
           [//]
           If the `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT' flag (or the `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DBUF'
           flag) is supplied, these queues will also be used to schedule the
           spatial wavelet transform operations associated with each image
           component as jobs to be processed asynchronously by different
           threads.  Regardless multi-threaded DWT processing is requested,
           within each tile-component, separate queues are created to allow
           simultaneous processing of code-blocks from different subbands.
           [//]
           By and large, you can use this object in exactly the same way
           when `env' is non-NULL as you would with a NULL `env' argument.
           That is, the use of multi-threaded processing can be largely
           transparent.  However, you must remember the following three
           points:
             [>>] You must supply a non-NULL `env' argument to the
                  `get_line' function -- it need not belong to the same
                  thread as the one used to create the object here, but it
                  must belong to the same thread group.
             [>>] Whereas single-threaded processing commences only with the
                  first call to `get_line', multi-threaded processing
                  may have already commenced before this function returns.
                  That is, other threads may be working in the background
                  to decode code-blocks, perform DWT synthesis and so forth,
                  and this may start happening even before the present
                  function returns.  Of course, this is exactly what you
                  want, to fully exploit the availability of multiple
                  processing resources.
             [>>] If you are creating multiple `kdu_multi_synthesis' objects
                  that you intend to use concurrently (retrieving lines from
                  their `get_line' functions in round-robbin fashion), you
                  are recommended to follow the startup protocol
                  associated with the `start' function and the
                  `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DELAYED_START' creation flag.
         [ARG: env_queue]
           This argument is ignored unless `env' is non-NULL.  When `env'
           is non-NULL, all thread queues that are created inside this object
           are added as sub-queues of `env_queue'.  If `env_queue' is NULL,
           they are added as top-level queues in the multi-threaded queue
           hierarchy.  The present object creates one internal queue for each
           tile-component, to which each subband adds a sub-queue managed by
           `kdu_decoder'.
           [//]
           One advantage of supplying a non-NULL `env_queue' is that it
           provides you with a single hook for joining with the completion
           of all the thread queues which are created by this object
           and its descendants -- see `kdu_thread_entity::join' for more on
           this.
           [//]
           A second advantage of supplying a non-NULL `env_queue' is that
           it allows you to manipulate the sequencing indices that are
           assigned by the thread queues created internally -- see
           `kdu_thread_entity::attach_queue' for more on the role played by
           sequencing indices in controlling the order in which work is
           actually done.  In particular, if `env_queue' is initially
           added to the thread group with a sequencing index of N >= 0,
           all processing within all tile-components of the tile associated
           with this object will proceed with jobs having a sequence index
           of N.
           [//]
           Finally, the `env_queue' object supplied here provides a
           mechanism to determine whether or not calls to `get_line'
           might potentially block.  This may be achieved by supplying
           an `env_queue' object whose `kdu_thread_queue::update_dependencies'
           function has been overridden, or by registering a dependency
           monitor (see `kdu_thread_queue::set_dependency_monitor') with
           the supplied `env_queue'.  If the number of potentially blocking
           dependencies identified by either of these mechanisms is 0,
           calls to `get_line' can be invoked at least once for each
           component index, without blocking the caller.  Otherwise, the
           caller might be temporarily blocked while waiting for
           dependencies to be satisfied by DWT synthesis and/or subband
           decoding operations that are still in progress.  This temporary
           blocking is not a huge concern, since threads actually enter
           what we call a "working wait", using
           `kdu_thread_entity::wait_for_condition', during which they will
           often perform other tasks.  However, working waits can adversely
           affect cache utilization and often cause work to be done in a
           less than ideal sequence, so that other threads might go idle
           while waiting for jobs to be scheduled by a thread that is
           unduly delayed in a working wait.  For this reason, advanced
           implementations are offered the option of using the dependency
           analysis methods associated with an `env_queue' to schedule jobs
           only when it is known that they are fully ready to proceed.
         [ARG: flags]
           Controls the internal memory allocation, buffer management
           and various processing and optimization options.  This argument
           may be the logical OR of any appropriate combination of the flags
           listed below.  For convenience, the `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DEFAULT_FLAGS'
           value may be used as a starting point, which will supply the
           flags that should always be present unless you have good reason
           not to include them.
           [>>] `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DELAYED_START': This option is important
                in heavily multi-threading environments, if you are creating
                multiple `kdu_multi_synthesis' objects and you wish to use
                them concurrently -- i.e., you wish to retrieve lines from
                them in round-robbin fasion, as opposed to pulling all the
                data from one `kdu_multi_synthesis' engine via its `get_line'
                function and then moving onto the next one.  By default (i.e.,
                without this flag), the `create' function causes as many
                processing jobs as possible to be scheduled as soon as
                possible to service this `kdu_multi_synthesis' object.
                However, if you want to work concurrently with multiple
                `kdu_multi_synthesis' engines (typically to retrieve data from
                a collection of adjacent tiles), it is better if the
                processing jobs that service all these engines are scheduled
                in an interleaved fashion.  To achieve this, you may supply
                this flag during the `create' call and then you should invoke
                the `start' function before attempting to retrieve image
                component lines with `get_line'.  The `start' function should
                be invoked repeatedly on all concurrent `kdu_multi_synthesis'
                objects, in round-robbin fashion, until all calls to `start'
                return true.
           [>>] `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_PRECISE':  This option requests
                the internal machinery to work with 32-bit representations
                for all image component samples.  Otherwise, the internal
                machinery will determine a suitable representation precision,
                making every attempt to use lower precision processing
                paths, which are faster and consume less memory, so long
                as this does not unduly compromise quality.
           [>>] `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_FAST':  This option represents
                the opposite extreme in precision selection to that
                associated with `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_PRECISE'.  In fact,
                if both flags are supplied, the present one will be ignored.
                Otherwise, if the present flag is supplied, the function
                selects the lowest possible internal processing precision,
                even if this does sacrifice some image quality.  This mode
                is normally acceptable for rendering to low precision
                displays (e.g., 8 to 12 bits/sample).
           [>>] `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_SKIPYCC': Omit this flag unless you
                are quite sure that you want to retrieve raw codestream
                components without inverting any Part-1 decorrelating
                transform (inverse RCT or inverse ICT) which might otherwise
                be involved.  For this to make sense, you should be sure
                that the `kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions' function
                has been used to set the component access mode to
                `KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS' rather than
                `KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS'.  This means that any
                non-linear point transforms (NLT) have already been
                disabled -- their effect is only seen if you are synthesizing
                output components, as opposed to codestream components.
           [>>] `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DBUF': Same as `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT' --
                see below.
           [>>] `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT': This flag is ignored
                unless `env' is non-NULL.  It specifies that the
                spatial DWT operations associated with each codestream
                image component should be executed as asynchronous jobs, as
                opposed to synchronously when new imagery is pushed in
                via the `exchange_line' function.  When the flag is present,
                the object allocates an internal buffer which can hold
                (approximately) 2*`buffer_rows' lines for each
                codestream tile-component.  In the simplest case (double
                buffering), this buffer is partitioned into two parts.  More
                generally, though, the implementation may partition the
                memory into a larger number of parts to improve
                performance.  At any given time, the MCT machinery may be
                reading data from one part while the DWT and block decoding
                machinery may be working to write data to another part.
                Multi-threaded DWT processing provides a useful
                mechanism for minimizing CPU idle time, since multiple threads
                can be scheduled not only to block decoding operations, but
                also to DWT synthesis operations.  If DWT synthesis is
                the bottleneck, it fundamentally limits the rate at which
                block decoding jobs can be made available to the
                multi-threaded machinery; the only way to overcome this
                bottleneck, if it exists, is to allocate multiple threads to
                DWT synthesis via this flag.
         [ARG: buffer_rows]
           This argument must be strictly positive.  It is used to size the
           internal buffers used to hold data that is obtained via DWT
           synthesis and/or block decoding within individual codestream
           tile-components, while it is waiting to be processed by the MCT
           machinery.
           [//]
           From KDU-7.2.1 on, a value of 0 is automatically translated to 1,
           while a -ve value may be supplied for this argument, in which case
           the buffers will be dimensioned automatically, taking the tile
           width and number of components into account.
           [//]
           There are two important cases to understand:
           [>>] If the DWT processing is performed in-line, in the same thread
                as that which calls `pull_line', then there is only one
                buffer, with this number of rows, and the buffer must be
                empty before DWT processing is performed.  In this case, it
                is usually best to select the default value of `buffer_rows'=1
                so that DWT processing occurs as close as possible to the
                point at which the synthesized sample values are consumed.
                This minimizes the chance that the DWT synthesis results
                will be evicted from lower levels of the CPU cache before
                they are consumed via the `pull_line' function.  However,
                in the special case where multi-threaded processing is
                employed, with both `env' AND `env_queue' arguments to this
                function being non-NULL, and where the `env_queue' or one
                of the super-queues in its ancestry advertises its interest
                in propagated dependency information (through an overridden
                `kdu_thread_queue::update_dependencies' function that
                returns true, for example, or an installed dependency
                monitor), then there are some multi-threaded
                synchronization overheads associated with the onset and
                completion of the internal DWT synthesis machinery (perhaps
                amounting to several hundred or even a thousand clock cycles),
                so in this case it may be better to select a larger value for
                `buffer_rows', especially where the line width is small.
           [>>] If the `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_MT_DWT' or `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DBUF' flag
                is present, the DWT operations are performed by jobs that may
                be executed on any thread within the multi-threaded environment
                associated with the `env' argument.  In this case, for reasons
                of backward compatibility, the total amount of memory
                allocated for buffering tile-component lines is given (at
                least approximately) by 2*`buffer_rows', since this is what
                would be consumed if a double buffering strategy were
                employed.  In reality, the internal implementation may
                partition this total amount of memory into a larger number
                of smaller buffers so that processing can start earlier and
                the memory can be used more effectively to manage interruption
                of threads, or scheduling of thread resources temporarily to
                other jobs.
           [//]
           You may need to play with this parameter to optimize
           processing efficiency for particular applications.
           [//]
           You should be aware that the actual number of buffer lines
           allocated internally may be smaller than that requested.  For
           example, the implementation may limit the total amount of
           buffer memory to 256 lines.
         [ARG: external_sample_allocator]
           If desired, you may pass your own `kdu_sample_allocator' object in
           via this argument.  The most immediate benefit of doing this is
           that the allocator will not be deleted when the current object
           is `destroy'ed so you can pass the same allocator back into a newly
           created instances of the same object and hope to wind up using
           exactly the same memory space for sample data processing and
           subband buffers for block decoding.  Since the buffers allocated by
           `kdu_sample_allocator' tend to be large, this may be very
           important, especially in NUMA (Non-Uniform Machine Architecture)
           platforms where most operating systems assign physical pages in
           memory based on the location of the CPUs that first touch them.
           [//]
           The `external_sample_allocator' may not safely be shared with any
           other object, since the internal machinery here invokes
           `kdu_sample_allocator::reset' and `kdu_sample_allocator::finalize'.
           [//]
           The `destroy' function will not delete any memory retained within
           an `external_sample_allocator' supplied here.
         [ARG: extra_params]
           This reserved argument has no impact on this version of Kakadu.

             This form of the `create' function is provided for compatibility
             with applications created with other versions of Kakadu.  It
             simply invokes the first form of the function with an appropriate
             set of flags and parameter values.
             [//]
             However, this function is NOT IDEAL if you wish to
             process MULTIPLE TILES CONCURRENTLY -- i.e., pulling image
             component lines from multiple `kdu_multi_synthesis' objects'
             `get_line' functions in round-robbin fashion.  In that case,
             you are recommended to invoke the first form of the `create'
             function with the `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DELAYED_START' flag and you
             should be following the efficient startup protocol described with
             the `start' function.
             [//]
             Note that the `buffer_rows' argument may be known as
             `processing_stripe_height' in other versions of Kakadu, but
             it has the same interpretation -- see the first form of
             `create' for an explanation.
             [//]
             Similarly, the `multi_threaded_dwt' argument may be known as
             `double_buffering' in other versions of Kakadu, but the memory
             consumption and multi-threading implications are the same.
        */
    bool start(kdu_thread_env *env=NULL)
      { return (state == NULL)?true:state->start(env); }
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           It is always safe to call this function, but unless the
           `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DELAYED_START' flag was passed to `create',
           the function will simply return true, doing nothing.
           [//]
           Delayed starts are useful only when using a multi-threaded
           processing environment (of which `env' must be a member) and
           then only when you wish to work with multiple `kdu_multi_synthesis'
           engines concurrently, retrieving image lines via their `get_line'
           interfaces in round-robbin fashion.  In this case, multi-threaded
           processing can be more efficient if you follow the startup
           protocol described below:
           [>>] Let E_1, E_2, ..., E_N denote N `kdu_multi_synthesis'
                processing engines that you wish to use concurrently.  Almost
                invariably, these correspond to N horizontally adjacent tiles
                from the source image that you wish to decompress
                "concurrently", so that the complete image (or a region of
                interest) can be recovered progressively, in raster scan
                fashion.
           [>>] First, you should invoke `E_1->create', `E_2->create', ...,
                `E_N->create', passing the `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DELAYED_START'
                flag to each `create' function.  This actually does initiate
                the scheduling of compressed data parsing and block decoding
                jobs to some extent, but it does not generally cause all
                possible jobs to be scheduled and it does not activate any
                internal asynchronous DWT synthesis processing jobs.
           [>>] Next, you should invoke `E_1->start', `E_2->start', ...,
                `E_N->start' in sequence, paying attention to the return
                values from these functions.  If any of the functions returned
                false, you should repeat the process, until all of the calls
                to `start' return false.
           [//]
           If you fail to complete the above protocol before calling `get_line'
           for the first time, the protocol will be completed for you, but
           processing jobs will not generally be ideally interleaved between
           the `kdu_multi_synthesis' processing engines that you wish to use
           concurrently.  As a result, working threads may not be utilized
           as fully as possible.
           [//]
           If you fail to complete the above protocol and you have your
           own processing queue (passed to `create') that is waiting for
           an overridden `kdu_thread_queue::update_dependencies' function to
           signal the availability of data before scheduling its own
           processing jobs to retrieve image component lines via `get_line',
           that event will never occur and your application will become
           deadlocked -- of course, this is an exotic way to use the
           `kdu_multi_synthesis' machinery, but it is one that can be
           particularly efficient in heavily multi-threaded applications.
           [//]
           In any event, the message is that you should follow the protocol
           described above or else you should not pass the
           `KDU_MULTI_XFORM_DELAYED_START' flag to `create'.

           you have already reached the end of the tile, or if the next
           component cannot be decompressed without first retrieving
           new lines from one or more other components.  This latter
           condition may arise if the components are coupled through a
           multi-component transform, in which case the components must
           be accessed in an interleaved fashion -- otherwise, the object
           would need to allocate additional internal buffering resources.
           If there is a component that you are not interested in, you
           should declare that using either
           `kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions' and/or
           `kdu_tile::set_components_of_interest', before creating

           Note that all lines returned by this function have a signed
           representation, regardless of whether or not
           `kdu_codestream::get_signed' reports that the components are
           signed.  In most cases, this minimizes the number of memory
           accesses which are required, deferring any required offsets
           until rendering (or saving to a file).
         [RETURNS]
           Non-NULL if a new decompressed line is available for the
           indicated component.  Each call to this function which returns
           a non-NULL pointer causes an internal line counter to be
           incremented for the component in question.
         [ARG: comp_idx]
           Index of the component for which a new line is being requested.
           This index musts lie in the range 0 to Co-1, where Co is
           the value returned by `kdu_codestream::get_num_components',
           with its `want_output_comps' argument set to true.  The number
           of these components may be affected by calls to
           `kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions' -- such calls must
           have been made prior to the point at which this object's
           `create' function was called.
         [ARG: env]
           Must be non-NULL if and only if a non-NULL `env' argument was
           passed into `create'.  Any non-NULL `env' argument must identify

           on the output component index.
           [//]
           It is worth noting that any component that has an associated
           non-linear point transform with one of the types `NLType_SMAG'
           or `NLType_UMAG' will appear to the application with an absolute
           integer representation, even if all decompression processing is
           irreversible.  This is done intentionally to facilitate the use of
           the SMAG and UMAG transforms in handling float or half-float
           original image samples that have been cast (re-interpreted) as
           integers.  In such cases, all that need be done with the returned
           data is to cast or re-interpret the samples values as floats or
           half-floats, as appropriate, possibly with some bit-shifting to
           accommodate any differences in exponent and mantissa precision
           from those of the standard IEEE float or half-float models --
           unsigned components must also be level shifted as usual before
           being interpreted as floats.
