  /* Notes:
        The `stripe_rows_left' member holds the number of rows in the current
     stripe, which are still to be processed by this tile-component.
        Only one of the `buf8', `buf16', `buf32' or `buf_float' members will
     be non-NULL, depending on whether the stripe data is available as bytes
     or words.  The relevant member points to the start of the first
     unprocessed row of the current tile-component.
        The `ratio_counter' is initialized to 0 at the start of each stripe
     and decremented by `count_delta' each time we consider processing this
     component within the tile.  Once the counter becomes negative, a new row
     from the stripe is processed and the ratio counter is subsequently
     incremented by `vert_subsampling'.  The value of the `count_delta'
     member is the minimum of the vertical sub-sampling factors for all
     components.  This policy ensures that we process the components in a
     proportional way.
           The `simd_transfer' function pointer, along with the other
     `simd_xxx' members, are configured by `kdsc_tile::init' based on
     functions that might be available to handle the particular conversion
     configuration for a tile-component (or collection of tile-components) in
     a vectorized manner.
        `simd_grp', `simd_ilv', `simd_dst' and `simd_lines' work together
     to support efficient transfer from interleaved component buffers, but
     the interpretation works also for non-interleaved buffers.  They
     have the following meanings:
     -- `simd_grp' points to the last component in an interleaved group; if
        NULL there is no SID implementation; the `simd_transfer' function
        is not called until we reach that component.
     -- `simd_ilv' holds the location that the current image component
        occupies within the `simd_grp' object's `simd_dst' array -- the
        address of the current `kdu_line_buf' object's internal array should
        be written to that entry prior to any call to the `simd_transfer'
        function.

         is empty, a new code-stream tile is opened, and the various members
         of this structure and its constituent components are initialized.
         Otherwise, the tile already exists and we are supplying additional
         stripe samples.  The object must have been `configure'd before
         this function is called.
            The pointers supplied by the `buf8' or `buf16' member of each
         element in the `comp_states' array, whichever is non-NULL,
         correspond to the first sample in what remains of the current
         stripe, within each component.  This first sample is aligned at the
         left edge of the image.  The function determines the amount by which
         the buffer should be advanced to find the first sample in the current
         tile, by comparing the horizontal location of each tile-component,
         as returned by `kdu_tile_comp::get_dims', with the values in the
         `pos_x' members of the `kdsc_component_state' entries in the
         `comp_states' array.
            In a multi-threaded setting (i.e., where `env' is non-NULL), you
         are required to supply a non-NULL `env_queue' argument, representing
         the queue to which the tile engine is supposed to belong.  If the 
         function is creating the tile processing engine for the first time,
         it should find the `queue' member to be NULL, so it changes
         `queue' to point to `env_queue' and makes sure that the `env_queue'
         identifies us as one of its members (demarcated by the
         `kdsc_queue::first_tile' and `kdsc_queue::last_tile' members).
         Otherwise, the function only verifies that `queue' is identical to
         `env_queue'.
            The `tiles_wide' argument is used by the internal algorithm to
         determine whether a negative `env_dbuf_height' argument should be
         passed straight through to `kdu_multi_analysis::start' to choose
         its own default double buffering strategy or instead set to a
         value which is large enough to accommodate complete buffering of
         the entire tile's data.  The latter is appropriate if the
         codestream has multiple horizontally adjacent tiles and the
         current stripe being pushed into the `kdu_stripe_compressor::push'
         function spans the entire tile.  In this special case we would like
         to make sure that the `push' call does not get blocked waiting for
         a first tile to absorb all of its data before we get to the following
         tile -- we normally keep multiple concurrent tile processing engines
         active even if we do not keep enough tile engines to span an entire
         row of tiles. */
    bool process(kdu_thread_env *env);
      /* Processes all the stripe rows available to tile-components in the
         current tile, returning true if the tile is completed and false
         otherwise.  Always call this function right after `init'.
         When the function returns true, the tile should be passed to
         `kdu_stripe_compressor::release_tile', which invokes its `cleanup'
         function.  However, for tiles that belong to a thread queue (`queue'
         non-NULL, equivalently `env' non-NULL), the entire queue should
         be passed to `kdu_stripe_compressor::release_queue' but not until
         the tile's last processing engine is finished (i.e., this function
         has returned true for all tiles in the queue).
            Typically, calls to `kdu_stripe_compressor::release_queue' should
         be deferred until the processing resources really need to be
         reclaimed -- that maximizes the degree to which jobs from different
         tile processing engines can be overlapped, which in turn minimizes

       interesting for multi-tile images.
          If sample data is pushed into tiles sequentially (all of one tile,
       then all of the next, and so forth), each tile gets its own queue and
       we generally delay waiting upon the queue and cleaning up the
       corresponding tile processing engine at least until we have finished
       pushing data into the next tile.
          If sample data is pushed into a whole row of tiles together, in
       interleaved fashion (one or more lines of one tile, then the next, etc.,
       then back to push more lines into the first tile on the row, and so
       forth), the entire row of tile processing engines is assigned to a
       single queue.  In this case, we generally delay waiting upon the queue
       and cleaning up the row of tile processing engines until we have
       finished pushing data into the next row of tile processing engines.
          In this way, we reduce the chance that joining on queues blocks the
       caller, which in turn maximizes the likelihood that worker threads have
       useful work to do all the time.
